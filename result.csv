"Delarosa is one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. I have been here at least 20 times and keep going back for the food. There is always a wait, but you can put your name on the list and walk around the cute stores on Chestnut Street. Now, they do allow you to call in and put your name on the list as long as you check-in within the hour which is definitely a nice plus to the dining experience overall.

To be fair, they dont list the ingredients of what a ""super burrito"" is, but there is no sour cream, guacamole, lettuce or anything that is usually standard in a ""Super"".

There is San Tung 2 next door, but people say that it doesn't compare to the original. The dumplings were amazing, but the show-stealer was definitely those tasty wings. The green beans were also very tasty.

I gave it the benefit of the doubt and sat through it. I thought it was the typical dim sum place where they push a cart around, but nope. You put in a order and they bring it out. So, I am like huh, this dim sum is about to be the freshest, but boy have I ever been so wrong. The chicken feet tasted like the chicken just got done running around and was soggy too.

So much flavor and technique here:The gnocchi w/the meaty sauce and the carbonara are excellent. My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the black kale salad, which they adapt seasonally. The octopus carpaccio is like nothing I've had before - so tender, fresh and light. The clams appetizer is a favorite - delicious sauce w/a bite that prove you don't need loads of salt to create great flavor. I even really enjoyed the perfectly cooked, tender skirt steak, which came with flavorful broccolini and potatoes...and I'm not a red meat person.I'm dying to try the seafood stew and unfortunately they can't do it as as a takeout item...so looks like I'll need to actually sit down here soon and update my review based on the service and experience.",food,place,takeout,gnocchi,meat,owner,appetizer,carpaccio,person,item,city,sauce,steak,stew,flavor,service,menu,seafood,restaurant,salad,tender,review,experience,octopus,door,salt,,

"So I just realized I mistakenly reviewed this location the last time I went to Tacolicious instead of the one I actually visited - which was the Chestnut Street location. Regardless, this location was just as amazing, if not more. I had been craving these tacos for what seemed like ages. I visit SF at least once a year but hadn't been to Tacolicious in about three. My aunt and uncle made it a point to take me here for lunch one day since I had been eagerly awaiting them. These tacos are some of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. And trust me, I've had a lot of them. I'm pretty big on tacos. They probably make up my top food group on my personal pyramid. We went on a random weekday for lunch and opted to sit outside since the weather was nice. They gave us complimentary salsa and chips which we devoured and we loved all the different kind of salsas. We also got an order of the guacamole which was delicious. I ordered the pasion as my drink because I remembered it from three years back at the chestnut street location. Just as delicious. For tacos, I ordered the baja fish and barbacoa taco - which was a special taco on their menu. OH MY GOD, they were just as heavenly as I remembered. The baja fish was perfectly crisp and the barbacoa was so tender and flavorful. I loved these tacos so much. I seriously wish they had Tacolicious in NYC, but it would be seriously detrimental to my healthy diet. I'm truly jealous of all SF dwellers because they have this gem of a place to chow down at.

It was hot and balmy, and there was live music in the plaza, which made outdoor dining even better. He ordered the pre-fixe lunch with lentil soup and gnocci, while I had the carbonara.I found my carbonara a bit too salty (probably from the generous amounts of cheese and guanciale) but the pasta was al dente and perfect. My bf's gnocci was tender and the ragu was tangy. The lentil soup was also very good, with the lentils cooked just so and not mushy.Service was good, but a bit slow.

"Gracias Madre was so friggin delicious, and that's being said despite the fact that everything here is vegan! Note: I myself am not a vegan and this was one of the first vegan restaurants I've been too. Needless to say--I was pleasantly surprised. I came here at noon with a friend today (a Thursday). We got seated immediately (no crazy lunch line woohoo) and it was pretty empty inside. I ordered the Bowl Dos, my friend got the Bowl Uno, and we split the Gorditas appetizer (fried potato thingy).The appetizer was crunchy and chewy, and not super amazing but the salsas they serve there (the red one!!) with it made it way more flavorful and tasty. The Bowl dos was SO delicious and satisfying with so much depth from the beans and creamy sauces and also brightness and a kick from the spicy salsa with pineapple (the pineapple in the salsa really gave the dish a nice sweetness/acidity and balanced out all of the flavors). There was so much going on, with the fragrant coconut brown rice, fresh greens on top, savory beans and sauces, etc. etc. I didn't think once ""dangit where's the meat to make this more savory/flavorful/satisfying?"" because it was perfectly delicious without it! My friend's Bowl was not as flavorful as mine (whoops sorry I'm that person who orders the better dish than the other when we ""split it"" heh heh) but had cashew cheese/cream which was savory (but not as delicious as my pineapple salsa heh...).The bill for a bowl and appetizer came out to be around $23/person (for lunch). Kind of super pricey and makes me very very sad, but the fact that this place is vegan and delicious AND filling (a rarity in SF) makes it a little less painful. I give this place 5 stars despite the expensive price because I think everyone should stop by and give vegan food a try!

"Five of us tried Zero Zero while in San Francisco attending a convention. It's convenient to Moscone Center and the neighboring hotels.

The dessert menu includes homemade soft serve with various toppings, which bumps my rating from three to four stars. The service from our waitperson was good, even though she was clearly busy with a number of tables.

"LOL I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO WRITE A REVIEW ABOUT THIS PLACE.I'm so done.Here's my story: Back in December, I was getting dinner with a friend here. I got here before my friend did. They seated me in this awkward-ass nook like right behind the check-in counter/host stand or whatever when there is plenty of seating in the center of the restaurant. I'm like lmao ok, that's cool. It's just a seat. (I honestly was just like 'lol', because my friend couldn't find me after she came in, even after I was calling her name. The nook is *that* awkward.) I got the Crispy Egg Noodles with Chicken because a lot of the things on the menu were overpriced for me, but this is also San Francisco, so okay whatever it's fine. The food came. It was ok, nothing special. Chinese food re-styled for mainstream American tastes. Same old, same old. (I honestly enjoyed it still, I'm Panda Express Fan #1 lmao)But here's the kicker. I didn't finish my food. There was just a bit left; not enough for a whole meal, but idk, I paid money for this, so I wanted to take it home. And so the manager or whoever in charge comes over and gives my friend a box, because she had a significantly larger portion left than I did, and didn't give me one. At this point, it's okay I mean - fair assumption that I wouldn't want it.But I wanted it, so I ask for a box. And this lady hella gives me this hella judgmental look and seems super reluctant to give me a box but I insist I want one and she brings one over.And so I'm honestly like WHAT. Are ur boxes made of freaking Tang Dynasty gold? Idgaf if I had one freaking noodle left, I paid for this and if I wanna take it home, I don't deserve dirty looks from you of ANY SORT. Unless your boxes are made of Tang Dynasty gold, which ok. BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE JUST YOUR REGULAR FREAKING CHINESE TAKE OUT BOXES. Bye.

"Great place for a late night burrito after a night out in the mission, no frills. ¥_You go in, tell them what you want, get a receipt, and then pay at the register. ¥_I had the carne asada burrito. ¥_It was the perfect fix after a night out, seasoned and not soggy. The guacamole seemed diluted and had tomatoes in it.The salsa bar looked less than desirable, so I skipped that. The bathroom was a hot mess, but with the volume and crazy people coming in on a Saturday night, it's par for the course.",place,asada,bar,receipt,salsa,bathroom,people,guacamole,carne,burrito,mission,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes they are expensive but boy is it delicious. It's an adaptation of fresh and fast street food but at ferry market price offerings. ¥_Last visit it was $3.50 for a carne asada taco. ¥_It's delicious enough that I eat here everyday when I'm out in San Fran. ¥_I have never had anything close or better to what I have eaten here. ¥_Their soup is good. ¥_The chilaquiles left something to be desired. ¥_Oh, if only I lived closer. ¥_I'm always happy to see the same staff every time I go there! ¥_I can't wait to go back for a taco or two or three.",taco,food,staff,asada,price,street,wait,carne,soup,chilaquiles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My cousin works here and I came to visit. This place ¥_is beautiful. The service is great. And the food is amazing. One thing I recommend is getting reservations because it gets really busy at night. During the day it is not as much. I loved the ceviche and the carnitas. And the caipirinhas are great too!,food,ceviche,place,service,carnitas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Short Version:I like this place. It's got a cool ambiance, very attentive and polite service, good food, and a huge selection of hard liquor. If it was up to me, I'd come by for drinks and a small bite to eat, or light meal before going out to a club. Their entrees are a little pricey for the small portions they give, but you don't really wanna stuff yourself before you go out, do you?Extended Version:Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter - 3 stars- You get four different pairs of dumplings. I liked the Chinese Chive Dumpling (3 1/2 stars) the most, then the Black Pepper Duck Dumpling (3 1/2 stars), which tasted a little like they used East Indian spices to make it, the Scallop Shumai (3 stars), and the Har Gau (3 stars)- On the menu, this is meant to be an appetizer, but if you're eating it by yourself, it should be enough to fill you upyelp.com/biz_photos/hakk__Wok-Fry Beef Tenderloin w/ Chinese Celery - 3 1/2 stars- This is my favorite dish here so far, and adding the Chili Oil (3 1/2 stars) made it even better (the Chili Sauce is good too, just not as good as the oil)- Portions were pretty small, but with a side of Steamed Jasmine Rice (3 stars) for $2, and a good portion of Egg and Scallion Fried Rice (3 1/2 stars) for $5, it's more than enough to fill up most people up to 200 lbsyelp.com/biz_photos/hakk__yelp.com/biz_photos/hakk__yelp.com/biz_photos/hakk__Crispy Duck Salad - 3 stars- It's not the kind of salad you expect since there is no lettuce in it, just ""micro-greens"". Tasted decent, and the duck was cooked well, but I still prefer the beef dishBraised Free-Range Chicken w/ Angelica Root - 3 stars- Looked at this and saw a piece of chicken with bone and barely any meat, then other pieces of chicken w/ their skin on it and I didn't expect it to be good, but I was surprised. It's a lot better than it looks, and the chicken skin practically melts in your mouthMisc.- For the first few minutes, I thought someone there was gassy because every few feet smelled like someone may have farted, but later on we figured out that it was just the smell from one of their menu items (don't remember which one though)",food,place,beef,meat,people,chicken,appetizer,dish,oil,meal,side,drinks,ambiance,stuff,liquor,service,menu,lettuce,portions,salad,portion,selection,entrees,Salad,duck,dumplings,greens,skin
"Great looking place. Amazing atmosphere, amazing food.HOWEVER, horrible attitude from a man name Eldon.A couple friends and I had the back room prepped for us. It was our friend's birthday and it wasn't his first time; he assured to us that the food at nopalito was amazing since it was everyone else's first time... and he was right, the food was great! However, we also all agreed that the server was just rude RIGHT off the bat. Eldon did not ask how we were doing as he approached us. He also sounded just plain ANNOYED when he asked us if we were having drinks, although we were a bit indecisive, it does not mean to RUSH us. We all just chose water instead of us ordering drinks right there and then. When we asked Eldon about the types of food, or if Nopalito has empanadas, or how the food ordering works at Nopalito (because obviously it was our first time) he responded a sharp ""uh yeah, it's right there ON the menu"", Repeatedly ""yeah, it's ON the menu"", as if we're not looking at the menu, we're just curious! He also cut my friend off while he was asking a question about substituting meat, but the server cut him off saying ""NO, you can't do custom foods, not going to happen.""He also made a disturbing comment towards the end of the night. It started with him stating how we should download venmo in order to make our lives easier upon splitting the check. Our table let him know a fact about venmo, saying that it usually takes three days to process (because really, we just want to pay right there to make everyone's life easier). He answered ""you guys can't wait three days?"", and our response, ""no we can't, we just want to pay it now"". Then he had the NERVE TO SAY TO US, ""sounds like you guys need another job"". Excuse me? Just because we rather not use a phone app? We all received our degrees, we work 9-5 jobs, Monday to Friday, working hard, and just want to have a good time celebrating our friend's birthday ON A SATURDAY NIGHT. But we felt so uncomfortable when the waiter had the nerve to tell us we need another job just because we're figuring out payment. Plain rude. You don't know what our occupation is, so who are you to comment about our jobs?Hence why I'm providing four stars. Just for his specific service. Good place, but don't want to see the server's face. We wished the ladies came around more- just smiling at us and asking if everything was okay. But Eldon REALLY pissed us off last night. Yeah, we're young, want to have fun- but does not mean that you can talk down to us. Oh, and he didn't tell us his name- it's on our receipt.Don't think we'll come back. Good place. But don't think we will.",food,room,place,meat,atmosphere,server,waiter,face,drinks,friend,service,receipt,menu,check,table,app,phone,order,water,birthday,wait,,,,,,,

"No clue why people wait 1-2 hours for this place. I suppose their French toasts are slightly unique, but otherwise it's a pretty basic breakfast. Sooo many other places to go in the city. On a personal note, I could not eat the food there: Once you are inside at the cashier, you watch all the men in the open kitchen. They do not wear gloves to make the food and, after watching all of their hands repeatedly dunk into the vat of egg batter, and all over everything, I became super grossed out and couldn't eat. It felt really dirty to me. I realize some people don't care, but I had no appetite after watching their hands all over my food.",food,place,appetite,batter,breakfast,cashier,kitchen,egg,people,city,wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hands down, a MUST try when visiting San Francisco! One of my favorite places to eat and go to with my friends. I don't think I've ever met another San Franciscan who has said that San Tung's is anything other than amazing! I always recommend this place first when I want to eat and hang out with friends and I always order their famous chicken wings with a side of their garlic green peas and just regular steamed white rice. Such a simple and delicious meal at a very reasonably price!",wings,place,garlic,order,rice,meal,price,side,chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yummy! Not my favorite pasta ever but I'm glad I tried it out. Had the octopus soup and it was very flavorful. The uni pasta I loved but you have to be a huge uni fan to appreciate it... Very rich but the breadcrumbs on top balanced out the richness. Definitely delicious and very different,pasta,soup,fan,octopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was having dinner with girlfriends in the Marina and Delarosa popped up on Yelp as a great option. I saw on the website that the team behind Delarosa has connections to Beretta (amongst other restaurants) - I love Beretta and was excited to try Delarosa. Delarosa was great and I would definitely go back. The bar is a great spot to post up while you're waiting for friends or to dine with another friend. We were there on a Monday night and we were able to get a table quickly at 7:30. The big windows give it an open and airy feeling, and there are a few tables outside for those rare warm SF evenings. Most of the tables inside are communal and by the time we finished dinner (around 9:30), the music had been turned up to levels that made it tough to converse. The following is how I would rank the dishes we ordered: - Crispy taglioni dumplings: imagine a cheese and prosciutto-filled dumpling deep-fried and sitting in marinara sauce. So good, so gooey.- Mushroom pizza: great pizza dough - I normally don't eat crust but this was an exception. - Crab arancini: yes, more deep-fried food and this was also cheesy and delicious but maybe not the best I've ever had- Panzanella salad: great flavored with the fennel croutons but the tomatoes were a bit too soft / over-ripe and didn't hold up well in the salad",dinner,sitting,food,bar,option,feeling,cheese,dough,salad,spot,table,dumplings,waiting,prosciutto,music,dumpling,sauce,pizza,crust,friend,,,,,,,,
Great lunch ... very busy but we still got good service from Joy .... unfortunately we had a family with a shrieking child that didn't even have the decency to take the kid outside. ¥_Luckily the staff politely asked them if they might be able to calm the kid down and they got pushed out of shape and left. ¥_Oh well .... I'm sure they will write a bad review of this place but maybe they should remember to think of other people when they're out in a public place .... we want to enjoy a nice meal and not have to listen to their unruly kid.,staff,place,service,meal,review,family,lunch,people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One of the few rooftop + outdoor places in the city. I have frequented this venue from the time it was Medjool. On a nice day, it's a fantastic place to be. If it's cold and windy (hello san francisco) it could be a little difficult to enjoy a cocktail. They menu has a good variety and I would highly recommend it as a Happy Hour spot on a warm SF day.",place,menu,variety,spot,city,cocktail,venue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If you're not looking for this place, you will never find it. It's a charming little hole in the wall, complete with swinging overhead lights as if a subway car was right above you, although it's quiet. Seating is a small bar that faces an open kitchen, where they cook everything fresh. The people that work there are courteous and sweet. I got the garlic house noodles. They were fabulous. Husband got the black bean tofu, which was very good but I like what I got more. We also got the fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce. Yum. Nothing was too filling. Perfect for lunch. And the prices were LOW. Would definitely go back.",peanut,car,place,bar,garlic,house,noodles,bean,kitchen,tofu,lunch,people,sauce,rolls,cook,wall,,,,,,,,,,,,
