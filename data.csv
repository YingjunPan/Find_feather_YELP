"Honestly, it's pretty good. Probably a little overhyped, but that doesn't make this burrito mediocre! Got the cabeza regular burrito w/avocado ""Dorado"" style. Dorado style REALLY makes a difference, it's sooooo good. I'm particularly impressed by how quickly our order was received and delivered! Only waited probably a half hour to order and get our delicious burritos. Satisfied :)","burrito,order"
This place totally deserves 5 stars! Great ambiance. The ability to choose music from a music app was awesome. Met some great people being that I am from LA and the servers bartenders and owner were all so friendly. Even bought us shots! Kept checking to make sure we were having a good time. Felt like we were old friends! We had carnitas quesadilla and omg to die for! •_The sauce served w it made it that much more amazing!

"We have been going for decades, not just years. •_It is our favorite Chinese Seafood Restaurant in CA. •_There Salted Backed Crab is a total winner, with a touch of class, a finger bowl to clean up with when your done.There pea green sprouts are the perfect compliment. •_Likewise, there clams and their lobster.It may be charmingly funky, but consistently good and considering how overpriced many of the restaurants are around Union Square, this is a port in the storm for business travelers. •_It has impressed our colleagues from Italy to Greece, with the great seafood. •_It's not flashy, but the food is fabulous!","crab,pea green sprouts,clam,lobster,seafood"
"Worthy of the hype!I ordered the original dry fried chicken wings ($12.50 for 12 wings) and came away very impressed. •_The wings are a good size, so don't get scared off by the price tag. •_The wings are coated in a delicious sauce but somehow retain a fair bit of crunch. •_I also ordered the chicken fried rice ($8.25) which was also excellent. •_It came in a huge portion and can easily be shared with 2-3 people. •_Also, if you only have 2 people in your party, try going San Tung #2 next door first. •_They have more tables that can only fit 2 people, so you may be able to avoid a massive wait time.","fried chicken wings,chicken fried rice"
"Very rude people. Was really in the mood for chinese food and I let my friend talk me into trying Emmy's once again. We got there and noticed that our total was still higher than expected (after doing math, and after we were rushed off the phone before getting total) They had the nerve to act like they never knew we wanted one of the items ordered over the phone to be part of our ""free item for orders over $20 coupon"". Told my friend that he ""should have said so over the phone"" - NO B#$%!, YOU SHOULD LEARN HOW TO LISTEN TO SOMEONE OVER THE PHONE. My friends' voice is the SAME as it was on the phone, which means they never really wanted to honor coupon anyway. The old jerk reluctantly changed the price/took off the item from the tab, which should have been done in THE FIRST PLACE. It's too bad they are so much of a local place so they can practically get away with such bad service, because our food experiences have been good, especially the Fried Rice and Honey Walnut prawns.Like I said before, if you're not gonna be happy about honoring coupons (or rush people off the phone once they ask about them) DON'T advertise them you pathetic unprofessional unethical jack-ass. Hopefully new owners take over soon once these guys finally have to take action from Yelp reviews.","coupon,price,tab,fried Rice,prawns"

"Ok if I had gotten better service i would have possible given them at least 3 or 4 stars, however the service was horrendous! We asked for a table outside on a Saturday afternoon, and luckily we didn't have to wait to long!!! After they seated us outside it took almost 30 minutes for our waiter to come out to see if we'd like something to drink. •_We ordered a glass of wine and water with ice. •_10 mins later the waiter comes back to take our order without the wine and without the water. •_Again I asked for some water with ice and she said she'd bring out right away. •_She took our order which included a salad. •_We ordered the meatballs, the steak skewers and a pizza. •_I wasn't feeling what was included with the steak skewers and the waiter offered to add some grilled brussels sprouts instead. •_About 15 mins later the meatballs came out and still no wine or water WITH ICE. •_Then about 10 mins later my steak skewers came out. •_I asked the server to please bring me some pepper, and he said he would, and I asked for some water WITH ICE. •_Finally about an hour after we sat down the wine came out, and she brought a bottle of tap water with glasses and NO ICE! I asked again for ice and our waiter said she'd bring it out. •_Another 10 mins go by and the pizza comes out and the brussels sprouts but still no ice or my pepper. •_By this time my steak is now cold, so I stood up and went over to the kitchen and grabbed some pepper myself. •_We were sitting outside and right inside the window next to us was the bartender so I got his attention and asked him for a glass of ice which he happily gave me. •_15 mins later the waiter comes by because we waived her down the first chance we could get, to asked what happened to the salad which we told her we were expecting first before our meals, and she responded, ""In Italy they eat their salad last"" WTH? We aren't in Italy!! We are in the US and we like our salads before our entrees. •_So she finally brings the salad out. •_ When the bill finally arrived, I was shocked to see she charged us for the brussels sprouts which she would give me instead, and for the salad which clearly she forgot. •_The food was pretty good but it was overshadowed by the terrible service we received.","service ,wine,water,meatball,skewer,sprout,bartender,salad"
"A little bit of a wait but let me tell u.. they serve the best wings ever. I had the wet version of the wings which are coated in the sticky sauce yet the wings manage to stay crunchy. It tasted like a mixture of fish sauce and a caramel sauce. We also got an eggplant dish which was just as good, a sweet and sour soup, and the black bean noodles. I wasn't really a fan of the noodles. It was raved upon yelp but I've had better black bean noodles. I would come back here just for the wings! They offer a dry version too which I would like to try.","wing,eggplant,soup,noodles"

"Wow! The SO surprised me by making reservations here the other night and wouldn't tell me where we were going while on the drive into the city. Finally arrived here and was lucky to find parking! Located along Columbus is The Stinking Rose, a restaurant that boasts that they season their garlic with food. Nice! The SO had heard about it on FB from one of his friends who said it was one of her favorite places to eat. Little did I know, the SO had planned to take me there for my birthday! So sweet *heart eyes emoji*We were seated quickly thanks to the reservation and were set to order since he's been Yelping a ton and knew what he wanted. We ordered: Bagna calda aka garlic soaking in a hot tub of olive oilBraised short rib for himSpicy shrimp fettuccine for meOmg the garlic cloves in the tub were so melt-in-your-mouth. We ate the whole thing and immediately feared any close social interaction we would have for the next week. My entree was aight, I wish I had gotten something garlicky-er? His dish was awesome tho, short ribs were tender and pulled apart so easily. Service was also very nice. All the guys who helped serve us during our meal was attentive, kind, courteous, etc. The best part of the meal was when we ordered a thing of garlic ice cream. Lo and behold another surprise from SO as one of the guys puts down a slice of cake in front of me with ""25"" candles he was probably carrying in his pocket all day, and says to me, ""Happy stinkin' birthday!"" *heart eyes emoji intensifies*The cake and the ice cream were delicious. The ice cream came in a huge bowl and the scoop was as big as both my fists. Some patrons next to us even saw what we ordered and got themselves one too! In the end, I had a great experience at the Stinking Rose and hope to be able to come here again! Well, maybe when my garlic farts subside..","parking,reservation,rib,shrimp,fettuccine,clove,service,ice cream"

Everyone's dressed to impress, but so far, I haven't seen anything that impressed me. Too bad their drinks are super expensive.

Don't add any green onion, or flash fried dry rice noodles, not nearly the right ratio of yellow onion or garlic. It was a hot mess and it sent it right back. My daughter's combination wonton soup came out first and she was practically done before I get t my meal... There was no order to when things came out, several people were waiting...and waiting...I should have followed my instincts and walked out.

Yummy yummy is one of my favorite pho places in SF. I would have to say that the pho at this place is almost identical to my Mom's homemade pho. Even when I brought my mom here to try their food she even said the same thing. Which is now one of her favorite places to come to in SF when she is looking for something soupy. Another reason why I love coming here is that it a small pho place run by a family. The staff here is very consistent and every time I come get fast and friendly service. The owner here is super extra friendly and welcoming. He loves to interact with his customers which is a plus because where would you every get something like that. The only con about this place would be that it is very hard to find parking when it is crowded so be prepared for that. Overall if your ever in town and your craving something warm and soupy you should head over to yummy yummy!!!,"service,owner,parking"
"Lady who does our facials recommended this place which was nearby. It was a warm day and my sister wanted Chinese style cold noodles. Restaurant supposed to be authentic Beijing style and Yao Ming known to frequent. Everything was pretty good. We ordered Beijing Cold Noodles, fresh hand-pulled noodles with just the right amount of chew to it served with julienned cucumbers in a sauce of chili oil, sweet soy, ground sesame sauce, and chopped fresh garlic. This dish was clean and simple. Many other places will add bits of meat or gunk into the sauce which takes away from the refreshing nature of cold noodles. This is the best cold noodle I have had. We also ordered the General's Chicken Wings which were lightly battered, crispy wings in a sweet and spicy sauce. Yum! We also had the beef pancake which was pretty good. To start, we had the spicy tripe and Hot and Sour Cucumbers. The spicy tripe looked bathed in chili oil, but the taste was off because it tasted like black peppercorns. The cucumbers were really good and were marinated in soy, vinegar, and chili oil. This vinaigrette went well with the tripe and as a dipping sauce for the beef pancake. We definitely will be back, but because of its location on Alemany just off of Mission, we won't be back until the next facial. If you are in the area and looking for Northern Style Chinese food like noodles or dumplings, you have to try this place. They also have a variety of other meat and veggies entrees.","noodle,chicken wing, pancake,beef,cucumber,trip,vimaigrette,dumpling,meat,veggies"

"I guess if you view it as a sport bar, it serves its purpose. But if you judge it based on the fact that it's a mexican restaurant then I would say it's ok - I've had better. However, in comparison to the other mexican restuarants that have recently sprung up in this area, I would say its one of the better ones to go to. So if you are in the SOMA area and wanted mexican food I would recommend this place next to (res agaves tacos - otherwise there are other better reatuarants in the area.",mexican food

When our drinks arrived, the server just put it on our table and left without any smile or word.

Note that there's no explanation on the drink section. But it wasn't bad, so i don't bother to give a complaint. Too bad the server who gave us our drink and check (the same person), just put our check without saying anything, not even seeing us. She was so friendly communicating with the next table guest.

They were kind enough to wait to seat us, even though I arrived 15 minutes late, due to SOMA traffic.I don't know any Italian--not even food Italian--and I think the waitress picked up on it, because she offered to explain everything on the menu. She even obliged my lactose intolerance (one wonders what I was doing coming to an Italian restaurant in the first place, if I can't eat dairy), and suggested that I tried the rabbit. It was delicious.My friends both ordered pasta, and from the few bites I tried, it was great. Very robust and fresh tasting. It's great that their menu changes every day, but I guess that's an expectation for a place where the size and cost of dish are inversely proportional.

"Had a craving for a porchetta sandwich so called in a couple sandwich boxes to go from their takeout menu. Ready in 10, you can save time by going strait to the bar to pickup and pay instead of their hostess. Basically, if you do not know about Porchetta, you don't know shit. •_For $11 the porchetta came with a warm arugula/fennel side salad and some pickled vegetables (celery, cucumber, etc). The flavor on the pickled items was intense like biting into a lemon type of way. The porchetta was pretty good, I'm a fan - 4 stars. Thick slices of tender and savory roasted pork wrapped in a foccacia like roll. I would have liked a little more texture and bite to the roll's crust since it was soft all around. The sweetness from the peach and red onion offset the arugula. I found myself missing the crunch from the pork skin and herb flavor from Roli Roti's version though. (yelp.com/biz_photos/Wd5h_Ü_)Barbacco's better sandwich imo is their roasted lamb - 4.5 stars. Tender lamb shoulder with garlic confit, mustard greens and fennel. The lamb had intense lamb flavor without being excessively gamey. My coworker who isn't a real fan of lamb liked it. Everything worked to create a sandwich I'd come back for.

So much flavor and technique here:The gnocchi w/the meaty sauce and the carbonara are excellent. My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the black kale salad, which they adapt seasonally. The octopus carpaccio is like nothing I've had before - so tender, fresh and light. The clams appetizer is a favorite - delicious sauce w/a bite that prove you don't need loads of salt to create great flavor. I even really enjoyed the perfectly cooked, tender skirt steak, which came with flavorful broccolini and potatoes...and I'm not a red meat person.I'm dying to try the seafood stew and unfortunately they can't do it as as a takeout item...so looks like I'll need to actually sit down here soon and update my review based on the service and experience.","owner,sauce,carbonara,salad,carpaccio,clam,appetizer,steak"
"My sister and I only had the first course meals: Ravioli con Pomodoro and Linguini Alle Vongole. •_The food may come off almost as bland to us Americans, as it did at first to me. •_However, I gradually found my linguini to be flavorful, actually, and very light. •_My sister appreciated her ravioli for its authenticity, as it reminded her of some of the meals she's had in Italy. •_Neither of the meals were not too greasy or ""Americanized,"" and unlike many other restuarant foods that leave me thirsty and tired, I actually came out feeling healthy and happy. •_Our waiter, who probably was the owner or the manager, was very kind and let us dine before the restaurant opened. •_His thick Italian accent and mannerisms matched the decor of the place. •_The place was nicely decorated without giving off a snooty vibe. This restaurant definitely had what I would imagine to be the ambience and the flavors of Italy. •_It is not the cheapest restaurant out there, though, so I would reserve it for a date or a get-together with friends/co-workers. •_I plan on going back and trying a full 4 course meal someday.","ravioli,linguini,waiter,owner,d_cor"
"This place is awesome. Their food is delicious, they are beyond friendly and their flat bread is amazing. It's cheap and quick, not a fancy place but exactly what I was looking for.

Great pizza but getting tired of 1-2 hour wait. Told it was 45 mins then got the text in an hour but still faced a 45 min wait until the dudes at our table sipped full beers. Don't text a table is ready if it's not. Kids were miserable after an hour and went next door. Only for the young and childless!,pizza
"It's a little far from where we stayed in union square, but we are so glad we found this hidden gem thanks to a google search!! I can't believe this place isn't packed right now! The atmosphere is awesome- the hodgepodge of furniture gives the feel of being at home and the staff is super friendly! We came two nights in a row after other dinner plans fell through! Food is amazing and seriously try a ""Mexican Mule"" cocktail!","atmosphere,furniture,cocktail,staff,food"
"As a lover of thin crust pizza, I must say I was almost converted after eating deep dish at Little Star! Ambiance: typical for most SF restaurants, this place was pretty small and the entryway definitely felt cramped while my group was waiting for a table. That being said, the actual dining area was spaced out well and I never felt cramped! Service: Very friendly staff! LOVE that you can order your deep dish ahead of time while waiting for a table. By the time our first appetizer had come out our deep dish was already on the table! Food: We ordered two appetizers to start- •_the chicken wings and the garlic cheesy bread. Both were pretty standard, nothing too special. The pizza though was delicious! We were able to do half-half and ended up ordering the ""White"" and ""Little Star"". The pizza was well balanced, but the star was the crust - provided great texture in contrast to the cheese! We also ordered the warm brownie to share for dessert, but it was only so-so and I probably wouldn't get it again. Overall, my pizza craving was definitely satisfied and this is a great go-to place if you are a deep dish lover! Would love to come back and try their thin crust!","pizza,ambiance,service,staff,appetizer,chicken wings,bread,brownie,dessert"

"Since my introduction to El Farolito, I come here a lot. And I do mean a lot. Because I live nearby, it's no problem for me to drive by when the hunger pangs call and I feel like eating something really really bad for me at 12-am. I've noticed that since coming here these past few years the quality has gone down a little and I no longer want to finish the other half of my Super Carne Asada Burrito. Instead, I've been getting the Super Carne Asada Tacos instead. Just the right proportions for me and a little lighter than the super burrito. Their salsa bar is awesome, especially the pico di gallo. It has the perfect amount of heat. I love that I can get as much as I want because I use so much it's like I drink the stuff. Speaking of drinks, the Strawberry Aqua Fresca is sooo good. It's the real stuff, cause when you get to the bottom, you get all the seeds and everything.","burrito,tacos,salsa,Fresca"
"I went to Yank Sing on a Sunday around 10am with a friend to celebrate a belated Chinese New Year for the both of us. The restaurant was relatively filled for an early 10am dim sum. We ordered off the carts and got around 11 dishes between the two of us. Everything was perfectly authentic and I was pleasantly surprised that they did individual servings of Peking Duck with buns and Chicken Lettuce Wraps. I have never been to a dim sum place that does this and it really solidified my enjoyment of this restaurant. I think there was also a special set menu for Chinese New Year because one of the ladies pushing the dessert cart told me that the Milk Tea Pudding was part of the set menu. Upon seeing how sad I was about that, she still let me order a serving of it. The pudding was very creamy and the milk tea taste was strong and authentic. It was really nice of her to allow me to order it and I enjoyed it immensely. This restaurant is definitely more on the pricey side though; for two people, it came out to be around $100! We each paid around $60, including tip. I've definitely had cheaper dim sum that is around the same quality, but I think the individual servings and the dessert really pushed this restaurant to 5 stars for me. I would probably come back with a bigger group so we could order more and try different dishes.","dimsum,duck,bun,chicken,wrap,pudding,milk tea,dessert"

The ensalada jimacan was ok but not special. The pork belly tacos were nice. Two of us already got their food while our friend was waiting for another 15 minutes. Funny enough that the waitress came by asking if everything were ok which should that she did not really pay attention.,"jimacan,tacos,waitress"
"I ordered delivery via their website, which is a bit more simplistic than their beautifully-designed menu. It was hard for me to find ""steamed rice"" on there at first, but once I did, everything went smoothly: reasonable prices all-around, good coupon offers, and a good variety of dishes.It's too bad they didn't take advantage of the web as a way to give more detail about the dishes, because had I known their version of Cashew Nut Chicken came with bell peppers, I would have asked for them to be removed--one of the people I was eating with was allergic and couldn't eat the dish at all! It's nice to be able to specify any special comments/requests about the dishes when you order, but only if dishes are prepared the way you expect, and ours weren't.The other dish, Sweet and Sour Chicken, was good, but it was mainly chicken and onions. There were a few bell peppers in there, but no other vegetables, and no pineapples that I could find, which is often my favorite part of this dish!The steamed rice was good--not too dry or too moist, and we got plenty to go around for three people at only 75 cents a serving.Delivery was prompt and polite.","rice,price,coupon,chicken,pepper,delivery"
"I go there for years and used to be a fan. The portion in the past was quite generous and the food taste good. Recently, I don't go there too often because the portion has been reduced, price has raised which I don't feel surprised. However, I do mind my food not hot enough. It seems that the dumplings are just been taken out from freezer and stuck in the microwave. The filling is still cold while the wrappign is just warm.Moreover, they are a bit under-staff. Usually, I have to ask several times to get glasses of water, spare bowls or napkins. Sometimes, I just go to grab it by myself from the racks next to the cashier.I do like the iced red bean drink with milk. Watch out for the MSG though.","portion,food,price,dumpling,drink"
"Staying in Chinatown, naturally I had a hankering for Chinese. The Hilton recommended this place to me, and boy am I glad they did! The pan fried dumplings were fantastic! I really liked the way they served the wonton soup in a single large serving bowl; enough for my friend and I to split. Finally, the Kung Pao chicken was terrific. The decor is a little dated, but don't let that stop you from coming in.","dumpling,soup,chicken,decor"
"The food was great and the servers were cute -- not a bad start.Not really sure why my meal needed to come out on a plate the size of a large pizza -- it quite literally encompassed the entire table. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the salsa is pretty spicy for a restaurant -- usually you gotta know somebody in the kitchen in order to get salsa this spicy. My concern with the salsa is that it comes out in a mini carafe which was a nice thought at first. How nice, I thought to myself, I won't have to ask for more salsa if I need it! But then I realized that this means either a) they re-use the salsa from table to table or b) they throw away a LOT of salsa. Either way, I'm thinking something needs to change.","food,service,pizza,salsa"
"Things I love about Pedro's:-The space is awesome. Exposed brick, flat screens everywhere you look, tons of places to sit, including a huge balcony.-Our server, Stephanie, was very sweet and smoking hot. And let's face it, that can go a long way when attracting your neanderthal sports fan (eg. Phil H.)-Food, for the most part, was pretty decent. Definitely a good option for a pre-game bite....we really enjoyed the nachos grande with chorizo.-Food prices seem to be in line with typical, pre-game dining options: think $10 for a big plate of nachos, $3 for 'street tacos', etc.-Location! Location! Location! Right across the street from the ballpark, you really can't get any closer than Pedro's.Things I hated about Pedro's:-Serving food on paper plates, with plastic utensils, and drinks in plastic cups. C'mon, we are paying restaurant prices, treat us like adults and give us really plates and glasses.-My 'Cadilliac Margarita"" was WAY too sweet. And at $10, just not worth it.-$18 for a pitcher of Bud Light. Wow.-No happy hour on game days - we're sneaking out of work early to start drinking before the game, would it kill you to knock a buck off before say 6pm?The good out weighs the bad so three solid stars. With such a large space if you get there on the early side you should have no problem grabbing seats either at the bar or at one of the many tables available. But based on our one pre-game experience I think Pedro's definitely needs to step things up if they want to attract crowds when the Giants aren't playing across the street.","space,server,food,nacho,chorizo,location,price,pre-game"
"This is a great spot! I met a friend here after work and generally shy away from FiDi spots b/c they aren't my style. This place definitely has more of a FiDi feel and is a bit pricy but I felt like the value was there for the money. Really nice wine and the portions were generous for SF. We got a salami plate, cheese plate the brussel sprouts and cauliflower. All were excellent.I did knock off a star because my friend needed to get out and catch a flight. We didn't want to be too demanding so we ordered virtually no-cook food and asked they not wait to bring anything out. This worked well and the food came fast. That said it was much too difficult to get anyones attention when we needed the bill. We asked for it a good 15 min before we needed it and it took every second of that and more to finally get it from someone.","spot,wine,portion,salami,cauliflower,sprouts"

"This review is specifically for their AYCE hotpot - first of all, the selection of ingredients is a lot less than other places. •_Second, they're stingy with the condiments, after the first two bowls of chopped green onions (we were sharing amongst 7 people), they stopped chopping and gave •_us the long stems - that we had to tear apart to fit into bowls. •_The restaurant was half to 2/3 full, and it took so many requests and so long to get meat that a member in our party had to complain very vigorously before we finally got what we'd asked for, but by then the meal was basically ruined. •_It's unfortunate, because their dim sum is pretty good. •_I had a better experience at Boiling Hot Pot on Geary.","hotpot,ingredients,condiment,dimsum"

"3.5 stars.I've been wanting to eat here ever since a coworker and I passed by during a lunch-hour walk. I love the look and openness of Mint Plaza, it makes you feel like you're somewhere other than SF. Last week my gnocci-loving bf and I had lunch here. It was hot and balmy, and there was live music in the plaza, which made outdoor dining even better. He ordered the pre-fixe lunch with lentil soup and gnocci, while I had the carbonara.I found my carbonara a bit too salty (probably from the generous amounts of cheese and guanciale) but the pasta was al dente and perfect. My bf's gnocci was tender and the ragu was tangy. The lentil soup was also very good, with the lentils cooked just so and not mushy.Service was good, but a bit slow. I'd return, but would try something other than the carbonara!","plaza,soup,gnocci,carbonara,pasta,ragu,soup,lentil,service"

Not many people equate the Bay Area with amazing Mexican food, but they are so mistaken. Taqueria Cancun makes some of the most legit Mexican food ever. It rivals anything from Southern California. My go to meal is 2 Super Tacos with Carne Asada. They are essentially amped up versions of street tacos. They come with usual fixings, onion and cilantro, but they take it to the next level with cheese, sour cream, and avocado. The carne asada is tender and flavored to perfection.

I asked for the famous Fried Onion cakes (could describe it as a Chinese version of a quesadilla, but instead of cheese it's scallions and yummy sauces...) and then for a recommendation-filled menu. Told her what we didn't like, and got noodles, fish, chicken, shrimp, short ribs--no bones, don't worry--plate after plate, and then sesame balls for dessert...and we were all (4 adults) satisfied, with drinks, at $140.

"Another place recommended by a friend that I had never heard of but was dumbfounded when I learned that it was across from El Farolito's. (The one down the street from Balboa High, don't get it confused with my favorite spot on 24th and Mission) Smh. They have adequate seating, pretty spacious with a generous salsa bar. The cashier was polite. I can say it definitely gives you a faint ""Plaza"" vibe as if you were actually in Mexico somewhere due to the panaromic design along the wall. As for the food, I've had better. Don't get me wrong, the carne asada burrito I ate was a good sized portion and I appreciate the free chips but the quality of the food was so-so. What stood out and kind of turned my taste buds off was SALT, SALT ,SALT. The burrito, chips, and salsa all were just overly salted. Maybe I'm kind of unjust for critiquing this place a little too early but I firmly believe that first impressions are always the most credible.","seating,cashier,asada,burrito,portion,chips,salsa"

I wasn't exactly fat'n'happy at the end, but it was still sufficient. The main thing to point out is that the pizza is really thin (think rice paper thin.) For the ""Pesto"" however, that wasn't a problem. The pizza was still crispy and miraculously able to support itself. The other pizza, the Atomica, was less appealing (though still good.) The sauce made the thin crust too soggy. The wine went very well with both pizzas (can't remember what we got, but it was dry.)

"Los Jarritos is great. I wholeheartedly recommend ordering Kiko's Combination. For a mere $6.95 you can combine two of the following items (except burrito): taco, tostada, burrito, enchilada, chile relleno, flauta, or sopas omar. Two items plus it's served with rice, beans, and tortillas. What a steal! The Sopas Omar are like open faced pupusas. Delicious.Kiko's combination is not the only reason to go to Los Jarritos. The huevos have delightful names. Try Huevos Con Amor, Huevos Divorciados, or Huevos Queridos. There's a little something for everyone at Los Jarritos. I recently had the Machaca breakfast and it really hit the spot. Plus, they serve coffee in mixed matched mug, just like home. And sure the coffee isn't great, but Los Jarritos isn't a cafe it's a nice little Mexican place on a shady little street.","taco,tostada,burrito,enchilada,chile relleno,flauta,sopas omar,rice,bean,tortilla,coffee"

"AH-MAY-ZING.I was on the hunt for a spot that served eggs on pizza after I had dined at Tom Douglas's Serious Pie restaurant in Seattle. There HAD to be a spot in SF that did that, right?? Yes, there are plenty- but do they all deliver the same great taste? No! I am so lucky I found Gialina on Yelp.We had to wait about 30 minutes- they took our phone number down. If you don't want to wait outside in the cold, I recommend killing time at the dive bar next door, just bring cash. Our dinner was worth the wait! We had a bottle of chardonnay, an arugula salad with pistachios, atomica pizza and four cheese pizza. Trust me, if you do anything in this life time, order your pizza with an egg. The richness of the yolk just adds an extra special something to every bite. I think next time I will add two eggs to my pizza. :)Service is really nice and on point, food is fresh and delicious, and the restaurant is really nice. I will definitely be back!","chardonnay,salad,pizza"

The evening's pasta specialty was linguini with seafood a white wine sauce. I had a half portion and it truly was well balanced with the flavors of wine, lemon and garlic. It was a pleasure to eat.

"Very kind staff here and one of the best combo delivery deals around. For $10 you get soup, eggroll, an entree and rice.

I'm not even a Veganarian, but I found myself with the oddest cravings for their meatless Kung Pao. Then one day, poof, I was immune, nothing. It got under my skin though, quite inexplicably, so I'd be remiss not to bring this up..But I'm still giving this place the Trinity. Fast to your door Mission.

The veggie omelet was almost entirely veggie, with very little egg. Interesting, but I wouldn't order it again .The huevos rancheros were smothered in salsa and came with chunks of steak on top.

"You know what, I really like Mission Chinese Food.It's not Chinese food, and you probably shouldn't compare it to the hundreds of authentic Chinese restaurants in the City. •_Rather, you should view Mission Chinese Food for what it really is: Chinese-inspired food, with a smattering of influences from other Asian cuisines, all uniquely thrown together in a setting that is 100% Mission. •_Take it for what it is, and you may actually enjoy your meal. •_But definitely avoid the temptation to compare it to real Chinese food.As for the actual dishes, here's some stuff I tried and my thoughts:+ Tiger rolls: a bunch of veggies in a rice noodle roll; this is reminiscent of Vietnamese spring rolls, but with a twist. •_Tasty and refreshing. + Szechuan Pickles: nice appetizer dish, lots of spice and kick, the peanuts are a great addition for taste and texture+ Tea-smoked eel: this is similar to the Tiger Roll in that you have some kind of veggie and, in this case, meat filling in a rice noodle roll. •_Pretty tasty stuff.+ Mapo tofu: super spicy, HUGE portions, but overall just okay. I wasn't wowed by this dish. •_Even if I'm not comparing it to ""real"" mapo tofu, this is still kind of a lackluster dish, one that you can probably pass over.+ Thrice cooked bacon: now THIS was a stellar dish. •_They stir fry rice ovalettes with a mix of vegetables, spices, tofu skin, and more. •_What you have is a flavorful, spicy, chewy, and delicious dish that packs a lot of punch into each bite. •_Loved this dish. + Salt cod fried rice: now, I know I said I wouldn't be comparing the food here to ""real"" Chinese food, but a dish like this begs to be compared to the real thing because it IS the real thing. •_This is the standard salty fish fried rice that is found in almost all Chinese restaurants, and Mission Chinese Food doesn't try to do its own hipsterized version of it. •_Rather, they do the real thing, and it's a decent version, but nothing too special. •_I liked it, but it's a pretty standard version.+ Pork belly: wow, SO fatty, but I liked it a lot. •_The crispiness of the skin is delightful, though the amount of fat on this thing is kind of frightening. •_But that's also why this dish is good. •_But be warned: lots of grease!I was also pleasantly surprised by how generous the portions are - the dishes are just as big as what you'd find in an authentic Chinese restaurant, which, if you've been to one, you'll know that dishes in Chinese restaurants come with very generous portions. •_What else...food comes quickly, the place has a very ""Mission"" feel, there's usually a wait but it's not atrocious (we came here around 8pm on a Friday night and probably only waited about 15-20 minutes), it's kind of loud but not unbearably so, prices are fair though a couple dollars above standard Chinese restaurant prices. •_A unique eating experience, and I would certainly recommend this place.","roll,veggies,rice,noodle,pickle,appetizer,peanut,eel,tofu,portion,bacon,pork belly,price"

The rest didn't really match up to my expectation for a 3-dollar-sign Michelin restaurant.Service: Very average.

"I had a hankering for Mexican food (what else is new?) while finding myself downtown one day. I headed to the Ferry Building, since I remembered they have an El Porteê±o stand, but checked my map application for possible Mexican eateries that I would pass en route. My map pointed me directly to MIjita.I had already decided my order would consist of multiple tacos before I had even entered the building. Given their taco selection limited--carnitas, carne asada, pescado y vegetariano--my reluctance to order a fish taco unless it was recommended to me by a trusted friend, and my refusal to order a vegetarian taco, I ordered one carnitas and one carne asada for a total of $9.20, sales tax included--somewhat more pricey than I expect for non-gourmet tacos (Jose Garces' Philadelphia food truck, Guapos Tacos, has short rib and duck tacos for $4 each, just sayin'). I chalked it up to the location and thought no more of it as I awaited my grub near the water.I was astounded by the sheer volume of meat in each taco when I received my plate--I actually had to use the second tortilla for the spillover. Taste-wise, the carnitas was scrumptious--juicy and salty with some guacamole to boot; the carne asada...not so much--rather bland and lacking some sort of salsa to make it pop, perhaps a jalape. The tortillas were also bland, definitely in need of some salt. On the plus side, there was a ton of diced, fresh onion...2.5 stars (bump up is for meat volume, which I appreciate as a staunch carnivore). If you're desperate for tacos, stick with the carnitas and you'll be happy.","tacos,carnitas,asada,tortillas"

We had leftovers only because we were hungry before our reserved time so we ate a meal before hand but still wanted to go to Mission Chinese. The crowd favorite was the pork belly. We personally felt the dishes were a tad bit too salty. My group felt like the wings were not spicy at all. I personally have a really low spice tolerance and I felt like it wasn't all too spicy. The fried rice was good. This is a fun place to go to with your friends to try different dishes. I like this place.","rice,pork belly,pastrami,wing"

"NOT GREAT. Very over hyped for what it was. Food was good. Tasty but not amazing. Overpriced for sure. Portions were small. Pasta with mushrooms and no protein for 20 bucks is a bit much ( being that is a small portion).The music and ambiance was good and energetic.The first waiter was very attentive and polite and we talked about all the hot spots to dine in sf. We eat out every night unless we have a dinner party at someone's house or we host people at home. I'm a big time foodie and this place was just ..... meh. Then the waiter had to go home and he was polite and nice but did not introduce the new server.I am not sure how to say this although I'm a very direct person but the waiter who was running the food smelled horrible. I know is San Francisco and everybody is free to do whatever they want including not wearing deodorant, but it is a food environment which requires hygiene and that particular waiter with the long earring was not hygienic at all and the smell was very offensive. I understand chefs ask the waiters to not wear cologne so the fragrance does not interfere with the smell of the food but he took it to the next level and it was not appropriate. Then a female waitress showed up and she was pushy and on a rush to get out of there. I was not even finished with my pizza and was offering offering anything else.I asked for dessert menus and the smelly gentleman •_brought them. The desserts were good, the coffee tasted good. The wine selection was decent and we picked a Sangiovese.Overall, a mediocre experience. We are not cheap by any means. We dine all over the place and travel the world, but after the lack of good service by the waiters that took over when our original waiter left, they did not deserve more than 16 percent tip. Also, the waitress came to grab the check because she really really wanted to leave. Again, inappropriate. Flour and water think they are "" so cool"" and they were probably good 5 years ago. NOT ANYMORE.Go to SPQR or Delarosa, both are amazing places for less money and better, professional and hygienic service.And Flour and Water is also not cheap. We spent 250 dollars for a 2 top on a Monday. Flour and Water, get it together, there are a lot of amazing restaurants in SF and the hype will fade sooner rather than later.

"so close of five stars but minus one for wet burrito. I don't like when my burrito is dripping wet. It soaks the tortilla and gets all messy. I like having the sauce and lime wet it up. You walk in and wait in line. While waiting they make you more hungry by cooking everything right in front of you. Boy oh boy it looked so deli. I think the reason my burrito was super wet was because I ordered chicken and the chicken is soaked in the juices. I like juicy chicken but... I'd rather have no extra juice. Just my preference. Then you tell them what kind of burrito/ plate, you can change the type of tortilla to spinach or whatever you like, the meat and then wait again to pay. While you're waiting for your food( only takes like 2 minutes) you can walk per to their sauce bar and seriously, try em all. My fav was the verde (green) sauce. Orange was creamy but no spice. Red was okay but not really spicy and verde was perfect!!! At the bar they also have cilantro and onion. You best believe I went to town on that!!!Real good place to try out. If you don't like wet burritos, I recommend not getting the chicken.","burrito,sauce,lime,chicken,cilantro"

Went here last Sat night with a friend around 7:20pm without a reservation. We had to wait about 40 mins, and we were seated promptly at 8pm on an actual table and not the bar. I was super craving pastas that night, and everything on their menu sounded amazing. •_Locanda started us off with some complementary, perfectly toasted focaccia bread glazed with light olive oil. Then we proceeded to order the following:APPETIZERPizza Bianca w/Smoked Bass, Horseradish, and Dill for $9 (4 stars): To start off, this is not to be confused for actual pizza because it is NOT. It's more like large pieces of crostini topped with various ingredients. Despite having a dislike for horseradish, I really enjoyed this dish! I really had my doubts... but the flavors of the smoked bass and horseradish complemented each other very well, and the thinly sliced dill on top made each bite very refreshing. Great start to the meal!MAIN DISHES - THE PASTASLinguini with Dungeness Crab/Lettuce/Sorrel for $21 (4 stars): Delicious! Linguini is not my favorite pasta, but combined with dungeness crab? I'M THERE. The pasta was slightly wider than the average linguini noodle (probably why I liked it), cooked al dente, and there were tons of pieces of fresh crab meat in the dish. I ate the entire thing up, but I think I would've liked the sauce to be a little less oily. I was also thrown off a couple times by some small pieces of crab shell in the dish. Still tasty though!Radiatore with Lamb Ragu for $17 (rating: NA): My friend ordered this, but I had one bite. The texture of the pasta was good (Flour + Water was still way better), but I thought that the lamb flavor was a little too potent for the dish. Although I'm a huge fan of lamb, the flavor of the lamb seemed to detract from the other flavors of tomato, pecorino, and mint. It was still good though, and my friend devoured it all.Both of us really enjoyed our food, but I definitely think the service could've used some improvement. The service was a little sporadic... Our waiter was super slow at times, especially when taking our orders and giving us the check. But he did come back pretty often to fill our water glasses. To wrap up -- Locanda, your food impressed me (even though your service did not), but I still look forward to coming back and seeing what other types of pastas and appetizers you have to offer!","pasta,appetizer,reservation,bread,ingredient,bass,horseradish,linguini,crab,sauce,radiatore,lamb,service"

Love this place. Definitely want to keep this place my little secret...but here it is: One of the few Italian restaurants I know that offers a whole page dedicated to seafood pasta/ Italian cuisine. Start with the caesar salad! My all time favorites are the crab pot pie and sea bass ravioli in lobster reduction sauce. Salmon farfalle is rich and decadent as well. Definitely hits the spot if you're looking for a hearty and comforting meal on a chilly night.,"pasta,cuisine,salad,pie,ravioli,farfalle"
"They were severely understaffed on a Sunday evening. They seated us and promptly forgot we existed. They took 15 minutes to come ask about drinks, and then 30 minutes later there was no sign of a waiter. I even asked the host to send someone over and no luck. We left hungry after being at the table for 45 minutes.",wait
"My Thanksgiving trip back up to Nor-Cal consists of catching up on all the food places I have been missing out on.For one- Paxti's. My family loved Zachary's but didn't want to make that trek so I came here instead. It was delicious! Lunch special for $9.99 is sooooooooooo worth it! Salad, slice, and soda. Salad is humoungous!! And you can pick any from the menu- I chose the Greek Salad. Tons of freshly chopped veggies and a nice chunk of feta atop. For the slice I got the veggie. Super cheesy and gooey :) I loved the artichoke hearts inside. It was a bit salty but nothing a wash of soda couldn't help. The best part was the crust!! Flaky and delish!! I hate really doughy crusts and Paxti's crust is like a cross-breed of a biscuit and a trad. crust.

They were both delicious! My boyfriend loved the squid ink linguine and would of course drive back all the way to the city for it! For desserts, we got the Sardinian Ricotta and Saffron Cake, it was perfect. A flavorful, light dessert that didn't feel too heavy but was suffice for the sweet craving. As far as ambiance--it gave me a romantic/ intimacy vibe. It is a cute little small place so it's intimate for two or even a small group of 6 would still fit perfectly at this restaurant. If you want to come here just for a small bite and a glass a wine-- feel free to! They also have bar seating!Parking kind of sucked....so good luck with that! We had to park at least 5 blocks away.

Which was 400 calories vs. my usual 2,000+ calories alone w/the fetuccini. I barely ate what I got. Our waitress was super nice. She was very attentive. She noticed that I barely ate any of my food so she insisted to not charge me. The manager comes up to me and asks if I'd like some chicken fetuccini to-go, and I declined. And they still charged me. Not that great customer service, why would you insist to not charge me but end up doing so? It doesn't make sense. If anything, I should've just took that fetuccini offer to-go.

It's just not satisfying in that pizza way. You want that pizza from childhood. The one that's greasy with both tomato sauce and mozzerella on that simple crust - possibly with good old fashion pepperoni. Not that it has to be simple, like I love the crust at Little Star.

"Look no further for a prefect dim sum joint in SF metro area - this is THE PLACE! You wouldn't go wrong with any of their orders. I had tried many other places and by far there is no comparison. I read a lot of reviewers who complained about the long wait and lack of parking. In order to beat the crowd, you need to get to the place right before it's open (10 am on weekends). We had a party of six and we were seated right away even though there was a line outside the restaurant waiting to get in. This will also solve the issue of lack of parking spaces since there will be plenty spaces early in the morning. This proof the point when you see so many people want to wait to eat at Dragon Beaux, it's a good indicator of how awesome of this place is.","dim sum,place,party,line,restaurant,parking space,people"

"Update. I have been to Uva approx. 20 times in the seven weeks they have existed. That's 2-3 times per week. I've spent somewhere in the four figures. I have never done this with a restaurant before much less anything I've mentioned on Yelp. I hope that is saying something. Just some highlights:1. They do amazing things with greens I've never heard of. It's all about the pea tendrils. Zucchini blossoms (not deep fried) -- crazy. Barley-corn-fava-squid! Some other shit I've never heard of nor could remember if you asked me apart from it being delicioso. And this is ""supposed"" to be a meat/cheese kind of place first and foremost.. Even the veggies are interesting.2. The staff is universally adorable. And professional. I have to imagine that any dings in service are completely attributable to their being slammed at times.3. The carne, cheese and most of all *wine* are all geared towards sampling and experimentation. It has kept me interested all this time and they keep it fresh.4. Do not be afraid to go girly with the rosato, pignoletto, in bocca al lupo prosecco cocktail, salads, crudos.. Not every meal has to be heavy with tannins and fat.5. You probably know about the crudos and the cheeses but their *condiments* are standouts in and of themselves.. vanilla salt, son!6. I mentioned this before but it's worth mentioning again. The wine list is broad, interesting and pretty reasonably priced.7. Do not miss the sorbet. It's really creamy and fruity. Not at all sugary/icy.Something to keep in mind is that this is a perfect place to meet with friends and have a casual meal with wine. Each dish is around $4-8 and the wines are all $10-14 or so for 8 oz. carafes. 2 oz. pours are exactly a quarter of that price. Within that framework it is a fantastic experience. The atmosphere is airy and conducive to conversation. Their pricing structure and menu is very much geared towards sampling and experimentation, so I suggest you take advantage of that and explore stuff. And drinking. It's very good for drinking.","restaurant,pea,zucchini,barley,corn,squid,meat,cheese,place,veggie,staff,service,carne,cheese,wine,experimentation,sampling,rosato,pignoletto,cocktail,salad,meal,friend,price, menu,stuff,drink"

"OK, I should preface my review and say I am not a fan of House of Nanking. Brown sauce, loud tourists, brown sauce, rude waiters ....did I mention the brown sauce? Sauce just shouldn't be the shade of cow dung, I don't think. Back from a Yelping break (...I was out of the country so sue me!), I tried to keep an open mind about their new sister restaurant, a FiDi-focused place called, rather unappetizingly, Fang. I was hoping that the waiters would be dressed like Dracula and the Wolf Man but no. They went the more predictable route for this neighborhood, a trendy look heavy on the dark wood and orange lighting. I just kind of felt like I was at a Hong Kong franchise of Lyon's. The analogy is not that far off. The prices are pretty reasonable by FiDi standards, and the portions are pretty hefty. It's as if you mixed Max's Diner with Yank Sing in a blender, I think Fang would be the result. For all that analysis, the food is just a couple of inches north of adequate. Jamie W. and I first tried the $5.95 Fried Onioncake which was covered in a sesame sauce that was - yes, you guessed it - brown (see photo). It was decent, but it does pale in comparison to the same concoction to be found at Henry's Hunan right on the next block. We had better luck with the $13.95 Cooling Lettuce Wraps with chicken - but they don't give you enough lettuce to scoop up the filling (see photo). I also wish they would mince the poultry rather than dice it into chunks. I felt like I was eating a Hungry Man Special in a chuck wagon. The brown sauce came back in the $10.95 House Lo-mein with chicken, garlic, peashoots - but it didn't seem as overwhelming this time (see photo). The $6.95 Dry-Braised Green Beans were standard issue though nicely crisp (see photo). I welcome those anytime for dinner. I would likely come back to Fang for a business lunch since I'm just down the block, but it really doesn't feel like a dining destination to me despite the trendy touches. I'd likely go back to Henry's since I am a creature of habit. FOOD - 3 stars...ok...Max's meets Yank Sing, and this is their bastard offspring AMBIANCE - 3 stars...I hope you find orange lighting flattering to your skin tone SERVICE - 3 stars...a bit on the disorganized side, but they seem to come back for confirmation a lot TOTAL - 3 stars...I guess I'm just not that much of a Fang fan","review,fan,tourist,sauce,waiter,restaurant,place,neighborhood,franchise,price,standard,sesame,photo,franchise,lettuce,poultry,chick,garlic,peashoot,onion,cake,Lo-mein,destination,food,service,star"

But every once and a while I try an Italian joint.I came here with some friends for a Saturday night dinner. When you walk in you are overcome with the aroma of the food. It smells heavenly at this place.I thought it was interesting that they had a lot of Japanese artwork on the walls of an Italian restaurant. Just an observation.I thought the food here was decent, but ungodly expensive. I can't believe I paid $26 for a skirt steak. A SKIRT STEAK. This arguably the cheapest and lowest classes of beef. In its defense, this dish was pretty good. You can't go wrong with a steak cooked very rare; like buttah. This dish comes with a side of roasted cauliflower and greens. We go a plate of mixed cured meats as an appetizer. Nothing to rave about, which is why this dish only gets a mention. I would not come back here willingly.

"Not sure if I would recommend this one for families with young children because it's in kind of a sketchy part of the neighborhood, but once you get in the restaurant it's fine for the young ones. Many of the reviews on here describe having a bit of a wait, which I also experienced (about 15 to 20 minutes so not too bad). And the food was certainly worth the wait, as a local woman kindly told me on my way in! Overall I'd say it was a great place for dinner :)","children,neighborhood,restaurant,review,food,place,dinner"

"I had reservations yesterday at 630PM (via OpenTable) with my girlfriend to celebrate a personal milestone. I had kept it a surprise from her the whole day and just before we left, she guessed the restaurant based of the address. Needless to say, she was very excited as she loves Italian food and heard good things about Barbacco.We left our apartment in a cab at 615PM, and at 625PM while in the cab, I received a call from an employee at the restaurant informing me that she is canceling our reservation due to some type of flooding in the restaurant. It's not clear if that was a result of the rain the day before or if it was a plumbing issue. She said that they had fixed it in the morning, served people for lunch, and then something happened again. She said that they started serving dinner and since something happened again, they decided to no longer take patrons. This implies some folks were already eating dinner, and we missed the ""cutoff"". I also asked if we could get a reservation at the sister restaurant, Perbacco, and she couldn't help there either. I was very frustrated at this given that we made reservations a week ago and I ended up getting the cancellation 5 minutes prior to our dinner, when we were already in a cab on the way over.5 minutes notice after I've already hopped in a cab is pretty frustrating, as I ended up sinking money into the cab. We then had to find another quality restaurant (we couldn't use OpenTable since our reservation at 630 was still active and couldn't be canceled), that could seat us. The first opening we could find was 8PM, at which point we had to cab there. We were starving. All of this, because Barbacco decided to give us really no heads up or support in accommodating the inconvenience.I'm sure the food is delicious •_and service is excellent, but I'm disappointed in how this cancellation was handled. I was put in a difficult and frustrating position because of the last minute cancelation. Lucky for me, my girlfriend is a trooper.","reservation,restaurant,address,lunch,dinner,quality,service,food,cancellation"
"I always passed this place when roaming around Chinatown when I used to live in the Bay. There's always a long line out the door of this place. I haven't gone to a sit-down dim sum in a LONG time, so it was nice to do it again.Since it was only 9:30 AM on a Sunday, Great Eastern wasn't packed. We were seated right away at a table meant for 8. Oh well, I guess my bf and I can have more elbow room. Their dim sum doesn't start til 10 AM, but I guess if you're ready, they can have the cooks cook the dishes for you, so you can have it before 10. Between the two of us, we ordered 8 dishes-lotus wrap, deep fried taro balls, shrimp dumplings (not sure if they're dumplings, but they have a white wrap), Chinese donut wrapped with...a wrap (#55 I believe), meatballs, shrimp noodle wrap, deep fried pork bun, and..I can't remember the other dish. Anyways, out of all the dishes, my favorite had to be the lotus wrap. Though it was smaller than other places I've been to, this has got to be one of the better tasting ones. The rice wasn't as sticky, but it stuck good enough that the fillings stayed together. The fillings (chicken?) was juicy. It mixed very well with the rice. I also liked the deep fried pork bun. It was crispy on the outside, but soft like mochi on the inside. The pork was good, but the outer layer just outshined it more.Get here early because this place can and will get full! There's a downstairs to seat the overflow, but even with that, it gets packed. The service here could be better, but then again, it's Chinatown. Our waiter didn't give us a choice of tea, yet the older group behund us got to choose a tea they wanted. Oh well...They're only there to make money, not to make you feel comfortable. I'm just used to it having lived there for so long. Both tea and water are $1, so might as well get tea to wash away the oils that you put into your body.Overall, this place is okay. Just make sure you get here early, or be prepared to wait in line. The ""host"" when you ask for the check, adds up manually, at the table, without using a calculator. Kinda impressed me.

"I am an avid fan of Mexican food and have eaten it all over California. SoCal is known for better Mexican food but only because the people that say that have not had Vallarta. They have fresh ingredients, you can customize your burrito with any tortilla and go all veggies or all meat and everything on the menu is great! I first fell in love with their nachos but then went on to love their super burrito grill. One dayI added shrimp to that super burrito grill (fresh carrots, bell pepper, onions, zucchini grilled up plus beans and rice) and since then I've never gone back. I now call that the Kassandra special and have multiple people try it and love it.

"I've been here couple of times and every single time it's always packed with people waiting to get a table. This place is definitely one of my favorite Chinese restaurants to hit up! Especially their chicken wings are to die for! Mhmm...just thinking about them makes me drool. The fried chicken wings and the garlic spinach were absolutely my favorite things on the menu. This past weekend I came here to order to go and I ordered the chicken wings, chicken w/ mushrooms, combo fried rice and garlic spinach. The wings are super flavorful and honestly if my boyfriend wasn't around or if I wasn't sharing these dishes, I'd probably just eat all of the order by myself. That's how good they are!! Also, you can never get enough veggies! Especially the garlic spinach. It might be a simple dish to make but it's still tastes super good. The combo fried rice tasted good but it just tastes like any other fried rice that I've had before at a Chinese restaurant to be honest. The chicken and mushrooms were okay too, nothing special. My order took about 30 minutes or so to prepare. Overall, I definitely love the chicken wings from here so I'll be back to order more next time!","people,table,place,restaurant,chicken wing,garlic,spinach,dish,order,chicken,mushroom,combo,rice,order"
"Every time I go here, I hate it a little more. •_Here's why:1. The line to order drinks at the bar is typically 5-people deep.2. The line to order drinks at the bar operates either on a complicated algorithm or a chaos-generated multi-variable equation, because you can stand at the ""head"" of the line for 15 minutes and not get waited on, while people to your left, right, and rear all get their drinks.3. It is more packed with people than the sea lion floats at Pier 39 are packed with sea lions. •_Which is to say, quite packed.4. It is expensive beyond any resemblance to reality. •_I am okay with paying $15 for a drink, but every time I do, I need to know why I am doing so. •_And when I can't answer that question, I hate you a little more.5. •_High choade content. •_The ratio of frat-robots to humans often exceeds 3-to-1, which is ordinarily considered toxic to thoughtful humans. •_My collar popped of its own accord one time when I walked in.Past experience suggests I'll be dragged here again sometime, I won't like it then, either.","line,order,drink,bar,reality,people,human,experience"

"Don't come here looking for a handgun, however, the food will definitely blow you away.If you think that was cheesy, try their walnut bread with burrata cheese. That dish is insanely cheesy and delicious, it was not overly sweet with the honey but quite good as an appetizer. We also had the beef carpaccio which was good but nothing amazing, thinly sliced and almost tasted like smoked salmon but.. maybe I was just enjoying my Vulture drink a bit too much...They have a secret 'bird-centric' bar menu which is quite fun and the first drink, the hummingbird, is incredible. It's light, has egg white and is totally discontinued and will not be made again as told to us by our server. Apparently our table ordered the very last one in existence since they will no longer be making this drink anymore at Beretta. Plenty of extinct hummingbird jokes followed our courses. The risotto was incredible, we had a person with celiac's and we had to ensure it was gluten-free which they are (thankfully) and the peas infused risotto was perfectly flavored, like eating somebody's mom's cooking (definitely not my mom, she's Asian and risotto would be porridge). The squid ink one was quite adventurous looking since it came out black but was quite tasty and intensely flavored, not like the nasty seafood taste, but a more refined dark and tangy flavor that went well with my mixed drink, the vulture from the bird cocktail menu.Such a great experience dining here and the ambiance is great. The open kitchen is bustling and the folks are accommodating here (sat me down early and got me a table even though I had no reservation). This place is insanely busy- always packed and every table filled up on our Thursday night.

No that's not how I cook my chicken... no pink and when you cut it open you can see the silky membranes still attached to the chicken. that to me is undercooked. And what happend to the customer is always right? The server was not accomodating nor was she friendly about it. After sitting there not touching it, she comes back after 20 mintues. No customer service skills. Why didn't you get the manager or apologized and tried to get me something else and not say do you want to take it to go? Yeah, and actually cook it in my kitchen..

Now, I did appreciate that my sesame chicken, pork and green beans and wonton soup was ready in 5 minutes -- kudos to you on that. And I'd overlook that I asked for two helpings of rice and one soup, not two soups and one rice. No biggie. It's Saturday night, and I'm sure you're busy. But the fact that you managed to burn the chicken, and that even the soup had a burnt taste to it -- that takes talent.

The veggie kung pao chicken had large chunks of veggie chicken, almost too big to eat without cutting. The rest of the veggies were just large pieces of zucchini. Not very spicy either.

After asking a bunch of questions like: are you sure that you want to eat in our place, and showing the menu,bc my bf was wearing a simple t-shirt and not a suit,she was pretty confused about this situation with us,peasants,but finally decided to let us make a reservation.thanks.but when I came in and asked for her name bc of her rudeness,she told me with a super fake smile that we should leave. Actually this is the first time in my life when I came across such a behavior. So if you have a bow tie in your pocket and you want to deal with a rude personal-this place is for you.I'm super sorry that we didn't try the pizza,according to the reviews it's pretty good, and one star just for the rude hostess,bc if one element doesn't work appropriately-the whole system suffers","hostess,place,menu,reservation,behavior,pizza,review"

I've never even heard of a dim sum place accepting reservations! Call in or use the Open Table app-Modernized! They'll text you when your table is ready. And the cart waitresses have headsets to communicate. So, if you're looking for a certain dish they'll call over the cart waitress to come to your table.-Great food . . . the XLB (Shanghai Soup Dumplings) and the warm egg custard tarts were ahhhh-mazing!!!One star taken off for the price. Its just way too pricey for the quantity and portion of the food. I believe for 6 of the XLB's was $14 and about $11 for 4 egg custards. Can't remember any of the other prices since I wasn't in charge of collecting the money (thank goodness! I hate that job!).

One of the best pizza restaurants I've ever been to! We luckily found parking in the street and was able to walk just about 20 seconds to the restaurant. There was also no line and was seated immediately! Temperature was amazing so we sat outside.We ordered the Margherita pizza (they only make 73[?] of them a day!) and some of their fries. I highly suggest getting their fries! It's more on the sweet side but it also had bits of bacon in it to give a boost of a flavor.Customer service here was outstanding! Our server was prompt and refilled our water when it gets half empty.Would definitely love to come back here again!,"pizza,restaurant,temperature,margherita,fries,bacon,flavor,customer,service,server,water"

"Second time here and a little disappointed. Their ""Super Burritos"" are extremely simple and pretty dry. The chicken was large chunks, most of them were blackened giving it a burnt taste. Then just rice, beans, a little cheese and Pico de gallo. To be fair, they dont list the ingredients of what a ""super burrito"" is, but there is no sour cream, guacamole, lettuce or anything that is usually standard in a ""Super"". Price and size is decent, but I'd rather pay a little more for a burrito that wasn't so bland and dry.I would say the tacos are the better buy.

"Gracias Madre was so friggin delicious, and that's being said despite the fact that everything here is vegan!

We got seated immediately (no crazy lunch line woohoo) and it was pretty empty inside. I ordered the Bowl Dos, my friend got the Bowl Uno, and we split the Gorditas appetizer (fried potato thingy).The appetizer was crunchy and chewy, and not super amazing but the salsas they serve there (the red one!!) with it made it way more flavorful and tasty. The Bowl dos was SO delicious and satisfying with so much depth from the beans and creamy sauces and also brightness and a kick from the spicy salsa with pineapple (the pineapple in the salsa really gave the dish a nice sweetness/acidity and balanced out all of the flavors). There was so much going on, with the fragrant coconut brown rice, fresh greens on top, savory beans and sauces, etc. etc. I didn't think once ""dangit where's the meat to make this more savory/flavorful/satisfying?"" because it was perfectly delicious without it! My friend's Bowl was not as flavorful as mine (whoops sorry I'm that person who orders the better dish than the other when we ""split it"" heh heh) but had cashew cheese/cream which was savory (but not as delicious as my pineapple salsa heh...).The bill for a bowl and appetizer came out to be around $23/person (for lunch). Kind of super pricey and makes me very very sad, but the fact that this place is vegan and delicious AND filling (a rarity in SF) makes it a little less painful.

"Short Version:I like this place. It's got a cool ambiance, very attentive and polite service, good food, and a huge selection of hard liquor. If it was up to me, I'd come by for drinks and a small bite to eat, or light meal before going out to a club. Their entrees are a little pricey for the small portions they give, but you don't really wanna stuff yourself before you go out, do you?Extended Version:Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter - 3 stars- You get four different pairs of dumplings. I liked the Chinese Chive Dumpling (3 1/2 stars) the most, then the Black Pepper Duck Dumpling (3 1/2 stars), which tasted a little like they used East Indian spices to make it, the Scallop Shumai (3 stars), and the Har Gau (3 stars)- On the menu, this is meant to be an appetizer, but if you're eating it by yourself, it should be enough to fill you upyelp.com/biz_photos/hakk_Ü_Wok-Fry Beef Tenderloin w/ Chinese Celery - 3 1/2 stars- This is my favorite dish here so far, and adding the Chili Oil (3 1/2 stars) made it even better (the Chili Sauce is good too, just not as good as the oil)- Portions were pretty small, but with a side of Steamed Jasmine Rice (3 stars) for $2, and a good portion of Egg and Scallion Fried Rice (3 1/2 stars) for $5, it's more than enough to fill up most people up to 200 lbsyelp.com/biz_photos/hakk_Ü_yelp.com/biz_photos/hakk_Ü_yelp.com/biz_photos/hakk_Ü_Crispy Duck Salad - 3 stars- It's not the kind of salad you expect since there is no lettuce in it, just ""micro-greens"". Tasted decent, and the duck was cooked well, but I still prefer the beef dishBraised Free-Range Chicken w/ Angelica Root - 3 stars- Looked at this and saw a piece of chicken with bone and barely any meat, then other pieces of chicken w/ their skin on it and I didn't expect it to be good, but I was surprised. It's a lot better than it looks, and the chicken skin practically melts in your mouthMisc.- For the first few minutes, I thought someone there was gassy because every few feet smelled like someone may have farted, but later on we figured out that it was just the smell from one of their menu items (don't remember which one though)","place,ambiance,service,food,selection,liquor,drink,meal,entree,dim sum,chive,dumpling,pepper,duck,scallop,menu,appetizer,beef,celery,chili,oil,sauce,rice,photo,scallion,lettuce,chicken,meat,salad,skin"
"This place must be lovers' spot. My boyfriend and I first came here when we were looking for a place to eat when I first got here in the bay. The heated outdoor seating and the dim lighting dragged our feet to its doorstep. When we got inside, the decor is amazing. Its like a big italian pantry. They also have a bar area where you could get some drinks while waiting to be seated. This place could get really crowded, don't get too easily discouraged and walk away because the answer is right when you hold that menu with very affordable prices and it would just get better once you get your generous portion of food and the taste is surprisingly good.Now, I must say their tables for two are pretty small and it could get crowded once your food arrives. So if you think you'll have a lot of food on the table, try to request to have yourselves seated in a bigger table. We came to this place 3 or 4 times and we always loved it.

"I would absolutely not recommend Hong Kong Lounge 2. I should say that my party didn't do dim sum and ordered from the entree menu instead. The dim sum seems decent according to other reviews, which is a shame because I won't be returning to find out.First off, the ambience is just depressing. It was pretty dark inside on our visit and between the unpleasant color of the walls and the dark carpet, the whole place had a rather surreal (like spooky surreal) vibe.Anyways, I tend to associate this place with how its decor, and not its food, affected me which probably tells you what you need to know about the food. It wasn't bad--basically the same stuff you could get at any average place in chinatown--just horribly overpriced. In addition, I remember being surprised by my bill because we got charged for things that the server didn't mention were extra and usually aren't extra. I think they got us on refills for either the tea or the white rice?

They sell in orders of 1 or 3 I believe, I opted for 3 for all 3 choices. The prices ranged from $1.50-$3.00, which is crazy cheap for the size the items.What I thought was not sanitary is that they would wear gloves to get your food, but give you money and change with the same glove.

While the fire spicy may look intimidating, it's not that bad if you exclusively cook the meats in there separate from your vegetables. We split half that soup base with the coconut pork bone for some variety.In addition to the soup bases, there were so many meat, seafood, and dumpling choices. All the ingredients looked fresh, not frozen including the meatballs. The variety of noodles was vast as well. Favorites included the lamb, enoki mushrooms, ramen noodles, fish fillet, and the many different types of dumplings.

"Cheap, but you get what you pay for. Truly a takeout dim sum place, and they should make that clearer. At noon on a Sunday, we found the food was barely warm. When we asked the employee to warm it up in the microwave, we were met with a cringing, reluctant look. Best if you buy it back and warm it up in the comfort of your own home.The portions were large and filling, but that might be because they used a lot of flour in the dishes with wraps or buns and the ""skin"" wrappings were very thick. The rice noodle roll (cheong fun) in particular had thicker than normal skin, so by the end we started picking out the meat to eat instead.FYI, the Shanghai dumplings here are done in a different style with the flour buns instead of the dumpling soup wrap that is seen in some dim sum places.","takeout,dim sum,place,food,home,flour,dish,bun,rice,noodle,dumpling,meat,soup"

It's upper scale Mexican for a decent price tag and while the food is definitely above average, I think they might have one of the best Margarita/free chips and salsa combo's in San Francisco...err at least in the financial district. They bring a huge pile of chips fresh from the oven and they keep 'em coming. Served with three different spice intensities, you could almost make a meal out of it if the salsas were a bit thicker. Margs are a perfect balance of sweet and sour and for under $8 you're getting a steal for the area. Overall it's a great place for happy hour and if you don't fill up on free chips an excellent option to stay for dinner as well.","price,food,margarita,chip,salsa,combo,district,area,dinner"

"I love El Toreador the most. From its cluttered, decorative decor to its delicious Mexican fare, to me it is really the show stopper of West Portal.I recently brought my boyfriend here on the Fourth of July no less, as we are both big time Mexican food enthusiasts. I ordered the fish tacos, although I was a little reticent to do so considering they use fried fish, which tends to not be my favorite. I usually love fish tacos with grilled fish-it's healthier and tastes fresher. Actually, at ET, I usually order the spinach enchiladas, which are crazy delicious and a great choice if you are vegetarian, but I decided to branch out. •_The fish tacos ended up being a fantastic choice! I only needed one of those bad boys--they were huge! The fish was delicious, perfectly cooked and flavorful. The batter was light and flaky, and the pico de gallo was as fresh as can be. The dish was served with a small cup of black beans and a small cup of Spanish rice--I appreciated the moderate portion size. •_My boyfriend ordered one of specials: the Basa (fish), served with refried beans and Spanish rice. I was perplexed by the order--I prefer that my dining partners order something that I can eat at least half of--and I wasn't sure fish would be the best order for that. Boy howdy, was I wrong! That fish was slammin! It was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and garnished with some insanely delicious sauce I'd like to take a bath in. My man cleaned his plate--it was so yummy! My sister loves the cheese enchilada with green sauce. I have to note how much I love ET's salsa--it's worth a trip to ET just for the salsa! This sentiment is reflected in nearly every review of ET I've read. You know I loves the heat! I also have to mention the margaritas. We ordered a pitcher of fruit punch margaritas (see picture). We LOVED it! Hands down, one of the best margaritas I've ever had. We had such great service--it was really impressive. Our salsa was refilled without asking. Our waters were kept filled. Our food was served hot and delicious. Our server was friendly and fun.On the bathroom wall: ""Don't question authority, they don't know either.""The only bad aspect worth mentioning was that although the restaurant was pretty empty, a large woman and her friend were sat in the two top just behind me - and she kept pushing against the back of my seat and asking me to move my purse, etc. I'm not sure if ET sat them there or they demanded to sit at that particular table, but it was not the best. Lucky for them, we had killed that pitcher of margaritas so I didn't REALLY care, but it was annoying. Overall, awesome. It's my favorite place in West Portal, for sure.","d_cor,fish,taco,spinach,enchiladas,choice,batter,bean,rice,size,sauce,plate,margarita,picture,salsa,cheese,service,food,bathroom,restaurant,place,sentiment"

My recommendation would be to go before they open so that you can snag a seat once they open. If you miss the first seating, you better be willing to wait. There is San Tung 2 next door, but people say that it doesn't compare to the original. The dumplings were amazing, but the show-stealer was definitely those tasty wings. The green beans were also very tasty. I glanced at the weekday lunch menu and saw that they had some very affordable offerings, so that is something I will need to check off my list eventually.","chicken wing,recommendation,seat,dumpling,bean,weekend,lunch,menu"

"+ THE FOODThe food here is actually pretty decent but it's not the best dumplings or baos that I've ever had. After waiting for so long, my friends and I were excited to try their large XLB (the one that's so big you need a straw), but they were sold out!! We started with the shrimp toast, which is like a youtiao topped with a shrimp paste. I'm not sure if it was because we were starving, but we really enjoyed it. It was perfectly savory and the two different textures worked really well together. We also had their garlicky green beans which was very typical Chinese styled green beans, not all that special. Next came our pork bao that we requested to be pan fried. This was just a typical Chinese pork bun with lettuce and other vegetables. It wasn't all that special. We moved onto the two types of XLB- pork XLB and tom yum goong XLB. While both were filled with savory soups, we preferred the pork XLB over the tom yum goong XLB since it had less of a vinegry taste to it. The tom yum XLB wasn't spicy or sour like the soup usually is. Topped with meat and some ginger, the Beijing noodles were also pretty delicious, but it was definitely not enough to share for the 3 of us. We ended with the trio of happy ending buns- matcha and milk, egg yolk, and beet and taro bun. Of the 3 type of buns, the matcha and milk was our favorite, having a familiar custard-y, milky taste to it. - THE WAITDO NOT go on a weekend unless you know that are first in line. We arrived on a Saturday around 12:30 PM and we waited until 1:58 PM to be seated (it closes at 2:00 PM). Our food took a while to get out since there was still a lot of people waiting for their food. •_We were starving and cranky, making us feel that this trip to Dumpling Time wasn't worth it. - THE PRICESThe prices here are pretty steep, considering typical Chinese food isn't very expensive. However, this is more of an Americanized Chinese place and every plate is nearly $10 for just a few pieces. Although the food is pretty good, I felt that the wait and the prices weren't all worth it.","food,dumpling,friend,straw"

Worse, they gave our order to a couple who came in, sat down, and ordered probably 15 minutes after us. •_Again, the restaurant is super small, so we were keen on the fact that a table who had come in much later than us was eating before us, which is annoying in it's own right, and that they were eating what we had ordered. •_Then the waiter came up to us and said, ""Sorry, there's been a mixup, we brought your food to the wrong table. We're starting your pizzas now."" Ugh. •_So we wait another 15 minutes, starving (see above), watching a couple graze the pizzas we ordered.Ok so the pizzas themselves get 5/5 stars. •_Yes, amazing, delicious, mouth watering, unique pizza comparable to those in Italy. •_They are small though, and I would say, over-priced.Take away: Amazing pizza, though small portioned and over-priced.

"We ordered 1 pound of geoduck sashimi and received 10 paper thin slices on ice that weighed 3-4 ounces. The taste was was fine but bland without ginger, wasabi or any other accoutrements . We were shocked at the tiny portion size but did not complain until the bill came for $50 including tax for one dish. When I asked about price I was told we ordered 1.5 pounds, not 1 pound at market price of $30/pound.

"A trendy spot to grab dinner. I didn't even know this row of restaurants existed in downtown until recently. I was able to easily make a reservation online a few days in advance for a Friday night at 7 p.m. I definitely recommend making reservations. This place was super packed and there were also people waiting outside for tables.Get the house margarita! It was the perfect drink to end my Friday night. I had the chile verde and it was pretty good. Nothing out of the ordinary though. Don't expect authentic Mexican food, it's definitely not that. The meat was tender and the sauce was flavorful. I just wish it had more of a kick to it. My mom had the Huaraches ""tres Cochinitas"" which includes three different kinds of pork, chile verde, carnitas, and al pastor with pineapple. I like the al pastor with the pineapple. The pineapple added a touch of sweetness to the meat. They also give you free chips and 3 kinds of salsa. One of them was really really spicy so I couldn't really eat that one, but the other 2 salsas were great!","spot,dinner,restaurant,downtown,reservation,online,place,house,table,margarita,drink,verde,meat,sauce,pork,pineapple,salsa,chip"

"So I just realized I mistakenly reviewed this location the last time I went to Tacolicious instead of the one I actually visited - which was the Chestnut Street location. Regardless, this location was just as amazing, if not more. I had been craving these tacos for what seemed like ages. I visit SF at least once a year but hadn't been to Tacolicious in about three. My aunt and uncle made it a point to take me here for lunch one day since I had been eagerly awaiting them. These tacos are some of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. And trust me, I've had a lot of them. I'm pretty big on tacos. They probably make up my top food group on my personal pyramid. We went on a random weekday for lunch and opted to sit outside since the weather was nice. They gave us complimentary salsa and chips which we devoured and we loved all the different kind of salsas. We also got an order of the guacamole which was delicious. I ordered the pasion as my drink because I remembered it from three years back at the chestnut street location. Just as delicious. For tacos, I ordered the baja fish and barbacoa taco - which was a special taco on their menu. OH MY GOD, they were just as heavenly as I remembered. The baja fish was perfectly crisp and the barbacoa was so tender and flavorful. I loved these tacos so much. I seriously wish they had Tacolicious in NYC, but it would be seriously detrimental to my healthy diet. I'm truly jealous of all SF dwellers because they have this gem of a place to chow down at. Go here and have a taco for me. I'll be daydreaming about them until my next visit...","location,lunch,taco,food,group,weather,salsa,chip,guacamole,drink,chestnut,gem,place"

First of all I did not expect it to be like chipotle but then very nice modern to sit down in after grabbing your food.All I know is, I saw the women cooking behind the counter and I knew it was going to be Authentic Hispanic food. All the food was being cooked in front of you. The prices were a little high for being a chipotle type restaurant but *faints* it was worth the price. The food was incredible. I ordered the enchiladas with chicken and a pork tamale. The sauce in the enchiladas was so tasty not too tomato-ey and a little spicy! I've never ordered a tamal from anywhere except my grandmas but this came fairly close to being the best tamale I've had (love you grams) Would I drive five hours again and come back here? 100 times yes!","friend,review,food,counter,price,restaurant,chicken,pork,enchilada,tamal,tomato,sauce"

"Awesome find in the financial district. As a former New Yorker, I had visited both locations in Manhattan many times. This outpost certainly lives up to the legacy. Great location, bright airy atmosphere, and friendly service. It's great for a business lunch, but I have a soft spot for their happy hour. The carnitas tacos (2 for $6) and chicken flautas are my go to faves (not including margaritas of course). Its true that it can be hectic at times, but its great for a fiesta after work. For a full meal option, I recommend the chicken mole enchiladas. The sauce is delicious.

We ate both side by side, and hands down La Taq was the victor... Their carnitas were without a doubt, the best I've ever had. I prefer rice in my burrito, and La Taq does not put it in, and it did not matter one bit. I will say, the free chips was a nice perk at Farolito - and their burrito is much bigger.... but size doesn't always matter - right ladies??? The flavor at La Taqueria was unmatched.

It wasn't overloaded with cheese, which I feared, and the garlic + clam taste to it was very satisfying. Great dive place with a casual vibe. For $4.25/slice it's a little pricey but very filling.

I absolutely loved the fettuccine, the taste of white wine was strong, while there was an ample amount of clams. The gnocchi bolognese was also quite good and I liked the meat sauce. I wish they would give bread during lunch though, as the sauce would go so well with it. I did feel that the pasta did not stand out against the many many Italian restaurants in town, but this place offers relatively good value and serving size for the price.

We tried the Dan Dan noodles and the dry fried chicken wings. The noodles had good texture and flavor with a decent amount of seafood/meat. The chicken wings were on the larger side like other reviews mentioned. The larger size and piping hot temperature made it difficult to eat. The sauce did have a nice sweet flavor and the skin had a very satisfying crunch. The food here was fine, but didn't live up to the hype.

"Oh. My. Goodness. This place is as good as it gets! I had been wanting to go to La Palma for quite some time, and recently found myself down on 24th St. on a mission for some carnitas. Because I grew up in San Diego, I am a little judgmental toward the Mexican food of Northern California (i.e. Chipotle just doesn't do it for me), but as soon as I entered La Palma, I knew I found a gem. All around the store are homemade tortillas, salsas, guacamole, cotija cheese, chips, dried chipotle peppers, and other delicious things for you to take home to enjoy later. As you proceed to the back, you see the open kitchen where employees are making tortillas from scratch and preparing food. La Palma is doing it right. And my carnitas burrito was absolutely heavenly.

Everyone is basically there to do the same thing - either outside on the patio or at the long inside bar / lounge area.

Ask for a few plates and extra utensils and you're all set.

"Five of us tried Zero Zero while in San Francisco attending a convention. It's convenient to Moscone Center and the neighboring hotels. The Italian menu is eclectic and creative -- not just your spaghetti and marinara sauce.

Our drink orders were taken immediately then for the next 15 minutes...nothing. No drinks, no water, no entree orders, nothing. I finally ordered a combo of chicken tamale and a flauta. While the flauta was decent, the tamale was surprisingly flavorless. Surely not worth $13. Though the lady serving us was very nice, I don't think I'll be coming back here again.","salsa,chip,margarita,drink,order,combo,chicken,flauta,tamale"

"As a tourist in SF, I would never have found this place had it not been for Yelp - so, thank you, fellow Yelpers. I made my way over on my last day in San Francisco (for coffee lovers, look across the street for some really incredible beans - no brews, mind you - just beans), and left with a heaping helping of their lasagna - two meatballs added. It was outstanding - so great that I fashioned my own little icebox and brought the leftovers back to Denver with me. It traveled well, and was just as good reheated as it has been on the first day. Tip for travelers - ask for some plastic ware if you're staying in a hotel... I forgot to do so, and was too lazy to go back down to the lobby. Ended up eating mine with leftover chopsticks, which wasn't the best way to dig in. :)","tourist,coffee,bean,lasagna,street,meatball,lobby,chopstick,tip"
This was the first Mexican vegan restaurant I've ever tried. The food was delicious but very pricey. Especially for the mission district and Mexican food. I ordered the coconut ceviche.

"I have been craving authentic, homey Italian in a hole-in-the-wall place like this since moving to the Bay Area and we just happened in last night with friends - our four-top was seated without a wait, but I think we got lucky with our timing.This place is the real deal - as authentic as you can get on the West Coast and outside of Italy. Simple, expertly prepared, casual fare dressed up enough to feel like Sunday Supper. Family-owned for twenty-five years, Franchino is comprised of a husband and wife team featuring any one of their three daughters (""The SHORT One, The TALL One, ..."" Etc.). The trio serves up just the right amount of Old World charm you want in a place like this - great service, pleasant and passionate about their food, and if you're lucky the Mister will favor the joint with a duet, usually alongside one of the more attractive female diners chosen at random. Tiny and cozy, be prepared to wait if you haven't secured a table, and not surprisingly wine is the order of the day as this place does not have a full liquor license -- but you won't miss that unless you're somehow not a fan of wine.I enjoyed the Veal Saltimbocca - succulent and perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of mozzarella and prosciutto. Alongside it, I chose the pasta of the day which happened to be rigatoni -- my favorite!! - with meat sauce. The pasta was perfect al dente, and the entire meal was so good it almost made me cry. You can't pass up dessert in a place like this - I went for a cannoli which they make in-house, and oh my god - amazing!!

"I know Zuni to be a favorite among many...and a constant ""top ten"" in SF write-ups....that's why I got a table last weekend to celebrate my sister's bday. The good: 1. We were seated quickly and at a nice table.2. We were offered beverages quickly (they were not served as quickly but that doesn't belong on this list).3. Oysters were fresh and delicious (though I ordered four and was served three - also doesn't belong on this list).4. Didn't feel rushed at any time - which was awesome given the wait outside for a table.5. Our food server remembered to put a candle in dessert (cheese plate in our case) but didn't sing (not like every restaurant or server will, but it's nice).The not-so-good:1. Our food server was often missing in action...fine except when the entrees come before the beverages.2. As I mentioned above, I ordered four oysters and received three. Didn't even think to check the bill until it was too late.3. My sister ordered the pasta of the day and simply put, it wasn't very good. Nothing exciting about it and probably the wrong choice for a restaurant known for it's meat.4. My steak was good but not great and there was more potato than steak on the plate.5. The cheese plate was uneventful. Like, really uneventful.When you drop a couple hundred dollars on a birthday dinner and walk away feeling only ""okay"" about it, it begs the question of whether or not to return.

I especially love that it is tucked away, but when you look outside, it's smushed between an empty parking lot and an empty smoke shop with a line of 15 people coming out of this place whose storefront consists of a wooden bench, a doorway and a large window.

Add to the fact that they make their own mushu wrappers and it's just bite after bite of heaven in my opinion. There are also various other dishes that my family considers ""go-to's"" but we tend to mix it up every time we come. This time, we opted for the three spice noodles. The noodles were chewy, yet soft, but I didn't really care for the sauce - I thought it was much too sweet and definitely not spicy enough. The addition of sauteed squash was very nice though. The potstickers we ordered were HUGE. While I wish it was pan-fried and not deep fried, it was still very delicious.

"This review is for the evening hotpot.ENVIRONMENT:Extremely clean and well decorated. All tables and chairs are is prime condition, like new.FOOD:We ordered the mid-autumn winter melon set. It was fun to see a whole winter melon boiling in our hot pot. Food was good quality and authentic. The highlights of the meal was the geoduck (as expected) and fried rice. Their signature fried rice that came with our set was sooooo good! It was probably my favorite dish and I would definitely recommend it even if you're just there for lunch! The pork slices and ""pork belly"" (so thin it looks like store bought bacon) was bland - not much flavor and must have sauce added on top. The sauces are what you'd expect from hot pot except the peanut sauce literally looks, smells, and tastes like peanut butter SERVICE:Manager was pretty nice but he offered and forgot to give us a Chinese translation of the special menu for our older family member who can't read English. Assistant manager/supervisor (in black suit) was not so helpful. He kind of rushed our order and didn't listen to what he wanted unless it adds to our bill. He didn't explain the order very clearly and just didn't match the rest of the restaurant. He also never served us tea (we were tealess for like 10 minute until another staff came after he left with our order). All other staff were attentive and accommodating especially employee 0277 without an English name. He was very friendly and sweet - he periodically checked on us to help us cut the winter melon.PRICE:We ordered the mid-autumn winter melon set for $168. Feels like a rip off for 4 people since we paid the same price that 6 people would have. You only get one hot pot for that price, one oyster per person. We asked for two hot pots since we had a large table and one of us was pescatarian but the assistant manager/supervisor who took our order kept pushing us to ""add soup"" for $12.

"I really hate to disparage a place when the meal was on someone else's tab. But when I am just as underwhelmed the second time around, then something must be said. I've been to Eliza's on two occassions for work-related lunches. The only explanation I have for this is that my colleagues probably don't know any better or are too busy to figure out another place to have the end-of-the-semester luncheon.Eliza's seems to be trying to be upscale Chinese...hey, check out the Wedgewood china, the stainless steel chopsticks, the glass-blown sculptures...with that much effort in the details, you would think that they would strive for upscale food. But they're also trying to be mid-priced. It just doesn't add up to me! The food is largely uninspired, and while inauthenticity does not necessarily preclude quality, Eliza's just doesn't measure up to an objective standard of goodness. Sauces are either too salty or undifferentiated (hey is that the same sauce from that other dish?). Seafood not very fresh. I can't even comment further because everything is so unmemorable! Not to mention the service is really whacked out...they had a mad rush to clear our plates, but then took forever and a day to get us our check.2 stars because their lunch specials ARE pretty cheap (about $6 for entree, brown/white rice, soup) and the food wasn't really inedible. I suppose there is a subset of people who will find Eliza's appetizing, but if it were up to me I would rather spend my money somewhere else.

"The first night of our trip to SF we decided to come here for dinner. Let me tell you what a nice surprise it was to find a halal Chinese restaurant. It was a Saturday night. We put our name on the list and joined the other people waiting outside. We thought this must be good if people are willing to wait like this. After about a half hour we got in and were seated. The place is very small. They put huge mirrors on the wall to make the place seem bigger. In the whole restaurant there are only 7 tables (2 large round tables that could sit prob 8-10 people and 5-4top tables). The waiter was nice. We also met the owner who was also very nice. We ordered way too much food for just two of us but everything tasted good and we came out stuffed and with leftovers for later.

"I've been to the first Hong Kong Lounge, so obviously I needed to try this location too. They're so organized and efficient with their ticket system, and they seat guests fairly quickly. I would not recommend leaving once you get your number, because they will not wait for you!! I was told that it would be 1.5 hours until three of us were seated, and we only ended up waiting 45 minutes because I waited outside the whole time for our number to be called. The other two members of our party were wandering around somewhere, so luckily I could be seated first.We marked what we wanted on the menu while we were waiting outside, so this made our lives easier once we were seated. We tried a variety of foods, which were all pretty good. I especially liked the sticky rice in lotus leaf. The beef tripe was excellent as well. All the dishes came out very quickly, and unlike other restaurants, they do not try to rush you in and out of the place. Great experience and great service - would recommend trying this place!",na
"burritos are just always better in california, it's actually a scientific fact. these burritos are especially delicious. i have a friend who fancies himself to be a mexican food/burrito conneseiur, so when he was raving about this place, i knew it would be good. i copied him and got the works and put legit everything they had to offer on it, including their medium salsa and guac.i was not disappointed! everything was super fresh and flavorful.as many pictures have shown, these burritos are beasts- i definitely couldn't finish the burrito in one sitting and i unfortunately had to get on a plane, so i couldn't take it with me. needless to say, i immediately passed out from a food coma on my flight home. some have noted, this place isn't exactly spacious, so try and go at off hours or with a small group!",na
"The food was good, but the service was so interminably slow. •_It took ages to get the order taken, for the food to arrive, to get jam for my bread, etc.The outdoor seating is really lovely though.",na
I stopped in for two steamed pork belly baos after hearing how good this place is from a roommate. •_The red miso glazed pork belly was high quality and the turmeric pickled daikon really helped bring the texture together for each bite. •_I'm going to have to stop in and try the other varieties real soon!,na
"Abosolutely delicious dishes in a lively and colorfully decorated environment.Love the takes made with Jicama, salads and finally the fondue dessert.Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",na
"My friend introduced me to this Italian restaurant and I love it!I'm a picky eater when it comes to Italian food and usually I only eat home made Italian food, however I may just have a go-to restaurant in San Francisco when craving some pasta or tiramisu!We ordered a vegetarian salad, a bottle of their collector's Zin to start our night with.Bruschetta and margherita pizza followed.Steak with shaved truffle mushrooms, ravioli, pasta in arabiatta sauce were the main course dishes.We finished everything. The food was not loaded with cheese or grease. The desserts were super! Tiramisu, molten lava cake and affagato! I've never had affagato this delicious before!The staff is friendly and they speak with an Italian accent and kinda scream - I guess that's how they speak in Italy??I'll definitely go back. You must visit too, however I highly suggest making reservations else you could be waiting for at least 45 minutes or more depending on the time you show up.",na
"Pretty good hotpot and grill! You can choose from a whole pot with two different soup base flavors or half hot pot and half grill, which is pretty cool. There's an open sauce bar with a lot to choose from - my favorite is the Satay sauce and a mixture of the sweet and spicy soy :) they have some dim sum times, a variety of meat, meatballs, fish balls, seafood and veggies. The fish balls with fish egg filling is really good! Also gotta have the crabmeat and enoki mushrooms :) there is a huge variety to choose from, which is always great :) I also liked the •_condensed milk buns and green onion pancake, yum! It also comes with ice cream too! There was green tea, cookies and cream and a few other flavors too. We also got the watermelon juice which is really refreshing and goes pretty well while you're eating something boiling hot. There may be a wait during dinner time, especially on the weekends, but they are pretty accommodating so it doesn't seem too bad. They have a tray of candy and also serve hot food from time to time too! We waited on a Saturday night around 7pm for about 30-45 minutes maybe? And they served lamb skewers and French fries to help satisfy your growling tummies ;) •_I've came here twice and it did not disappoint! This place isn't amazingggg but I'd crave it from time to time!",na
"The only place in SF (that I know of) where you can find the rare, San Diegan delicacies that are the California burrito and carne asada fries. •_They do both pretty well, •_although a couple of times the fries in my burrito were a tad too crispy. •_Not over-doing the fries is crucial, man. •_ •_California burritos (well...and perfect weather) are pretty much the only things I miss about San Diego. •_So, whenever I feel that pang of ""homesickness"" in my stomach, I come to Los Coyotes! Problem solved.",na
The service is fast and the street style tacos were good but the price was really high. I guess you expect that in the Market District but this still seemed off the scale.,na
Really great place to eat and grab a drink. •_The food is very flavorful and the staff is awesome!,na
"Seriously worth the hype. Garaje is the stuff taco dreams are made of (What, you don't have taco dreams?). I ordered two Como se Llama taco (one with chicken, one with steak) and I was seriously full for the rest of the day. A crispy taco embedded in a cheesy flour tortilla with refritos, then filled with chicken/steak, pico de gallo, and guacamole - all for $6. Truly delicious.Water is self serve, food is cash only. Funky, fun ambiance. Bus your own damn tables. Altogether delightful.",na
"Really good! I love Italian, this place is great for dates. I saw a lot of couples here having wine and chit chatting away, I also saw group of friends just having a nice meal together. The service was kind of off, kept switching off from the lady with the really nice accent, Ramona I think (sorry), to another guy who was really nice with helping us. My bf took me here the other night and it was really nice and romantic. Dim lights and a little cute candle in the middle of your table. The food was amazing, the appetizer was on point, the bruschetta! The tomatoes were the right flavor and it all combined perfectly together. I got the Sorrentina, wasn't what I expected because I like to look at pictures to know what I'm ordering (that's what yell is for duh) but it was really good anyway! My bf got the salmon dish, I tried it and it was good too. The sauce is delicious but the noodles may have been undercooked for it was a tad bit hard. After we had the flan for dessert and it was so good! I loved it here!",na

"After reading all the great reviews we decided to take the drive from Oakland all the way to try this place out. •_While the food is great, it really wasn't worth the drive out there. •_There are only 2 things that I liked... 1) they have the best potstickers I've ever had... and i've had a lot in my 31yrs of life lol •_and 2)normally a lot of asian restaurants use so much oil in their cooking. •_not this place. •_the food was oil free, very very delicious. •_Also the portion size for what you order is definitely not to be desired. •_If you're not a local skip it. •_And if you do decide to go don't listen to everyone and get the cummin beef. •_it was beef with a whole bottle of cummin. •_lol not that great. •_:)",na
"Dinner = yummy, especially the pizzas, but you can't go wrong with the pasta, either. Brunch = awesome (biscuits and gravy!!)Bottomless bellinis at brunch = delicious (and generous...)Wine list = extensiveYou should definitely try this place on your next date night or girl's brunch.",na
"Very cute ambiance, I came here a few times but the wait was over an hour so we always left. This time we came 10mins before they opened at11am on a Saturday and was seated right at 11! We came for the king xiao long bao that was so well known for the size and how you have to drink it with a boba straw. It was very juicy and delicious. We also ordered the shrimp toast, shrimp and chive dumpling and trio bun. All very tasty which is good when you're paying a premium for the ambiance and Instagram worthy foods.",na
"Nice place , cheap and good testy pizza at Italy area in sf. Easy to find and either u can eat inside or to takeaway!",na
"I've been eyeing this place since the last time I visited San Francisco 6 months ago, so needless to say, this was my first meal stop when I landed in the city again. Food-wise, I loved it. Space-wise, be prepared to talk about nothing important since chances are the rest of the restaurant are probably listening on your conversation too. The tables are put so closely together that I had to (as politely as I could) tell my friend to talk more quietly multiple times throughout our meal. For starters, we ordered the Sweet Potato Fries",na
"Crossing over to the Northern Chinese Cuisine, I tried this place with a friend! •_I must say I was pleasantly surprised that Yao Ming must have ate here because his picture was on the wall. •_I tried the sour cabbage warm pot and it really hit the spot! •_My friend also ordered the Mu-shu chicken and it was really good with just the right amount of veggie to meat ratio. •_Try the onion pancake! •_Honestly it was the best that I have eaten in the bay area! •_Not too greasy but just enough crisp, flakiness to explode more flavors into your mouth. •_I look forward to trying other dishes!",na
"My husband works in the building so I've sat in the car across the street and watched the crowds walking in. You'd think judging the crowd it'd be a great place. Today my husband asked me to meet him and his colleague for pre-dinner drinks. They got there just before Happy Hour ended and the waiter suggested a jug of margarita (which he claims is 5-6 glasses). Like some men, my husband didn't ask about the price. When I signed the bill, I got sticker shock- the jug costs $84! It was basically billed as 7 glasses of the El Jimador Clasico!!! The bill was $111 for a jug of margarita, 1 order of guac and a (Happy Hour) beer. And to make matters worse, we were sitting just off the bar and it took the staff 10 minutes to notice us signaling for the check and another 5 minutes to bring it. Ok, first AND last time then.",na
"Homemade Orchata just tastes divine. Not too sweet with rice dominating and making me smile.Three other guests at the table, one chef and two in cooking school, one of them from the Yucatan, MX. They were all highly pleased with level of spice (high), service (excellent), and the over all deep authenticity of the food. Dining room is medium sized with bright decor and clean bathrooms. Sort of an odd spot right on 16th at S. Van Ness feels sort of out of the way or like you wouldn't just pop by. Menu is accented heavily by the meat items, although there are veggies options, it feels like you are missing the point. Never fun for a vegetarian. Their specials change every day and they obviously care about the food they prepare.Definitely worth a vist!",na
I would definitely recommend Rose's Cafe . I had brunch on the patio the food and service were impeccable.,na
"One of my new favorite restaurants and I go out to eat. alot!!My friend and I decided not to make a reservation and just try and get a seat at the bar. We got there around 6:30 on a Thursday night and lucked out because we only waited about 10 minutes before a couple left. The food was delicious!What we ordered:1) Jewish artichokes - if you like artichokes, you will love this. Crispy and savory.2) Duck egg w/asparagus - My friend's fave dish. The egg was delightful and the butter sauce was good. Dip your bread in the leftover egg + sauce mixture. You won't be sorry.3) Pizza bianca. 3 choices but we got the one with califlower. Delish! A little spicy too which i enjoy. If you dont like spicy food, maybe you should get one of the others..4) Entree - Rigatoni alla Carbonara - Super rich. I mean, honestly, I couldnt finish it. It was sooo thick and meaty even though you couldn't really see the meat in it. I think it was the sauce. Really heavy and might make you sick if you eat it all. Just saying.5) Entree - Bavette Steak - $26?? Um sorry not worth the price. It was good, but not $26 good. Plus the sauce tasted like hot dog. Don't believe me? Try it. All in all a good meal. Next time I go, i might pass up the entrees all together or at least try another pasta. The appetizers and small plates were the WOW-factor for me and this restaurant. Plus, with all the food we got plus 2 drinks ($10 each), the bill came out to $102 for 2 people!! Everything adds up. You order this and that and booom, a fatty bill so be careful.Will have to remove a star for the price. Sorry! :(BUT what I really really appreciated from this restaurant was the customer service. World class. The bartenders were really friendly and looked like they really really enjoyed making drinks :)Also, as we were walking out, a gentleman stopped us and said that he worked for the sister restaurant Delfina and wanted to let us know that there was a stabbing in the area recently and wanted us to be safe. That made me feel really good because they honestly care for their patrons.",na
"First time there, very Italian(fun). We all had the ravioli's they were very tasty we would recommend to anyone. •_North Beach is a fun area. Stopped and had gelato at the deli next door on the way back.",na
"This is one of my favorite places to get dumplings. My bf and I eagerly arrived to get brunch for our very second time here. Per usual there was a long line so we put our names down and decided to wonder around Taraval street. We came back 30 mins later, but it seemed that they had already called our name. I explained to the hostess that we had put our name earlier, but weren't here when they called our name. I hoped that they would understand and perhaps place us higher on the waitlist, which had grown significantly since we left. She told us that this was not possible and put our name at the bottom of the list. She told me that she had called our name and since we weren't here we have to wait from the bottom again!Since my bf and I came all the way out here for this place, we decided to wait at the restaurant, fearing that we'd miss the call again. But the situation upset me. Does it make sense for people to wait all 30-40 minute right infront of their restaurant when the line is long and the weather is cold? How does it help them to have so many people crowded at their entrance? I'd recommend the business to be more lenient in these situations and think from the customer's experience, especially considering that they have a rather long wait time. We waited 20 more minutes before we were finally seated.",na
"Still a fan.Had lunch with the same mentor from two years ago, who's still cheering me on as I look for another job.We both had eggplant dishes, mine not spicy but his, very much yes. •_What's great is that your meal comes with soup. This time it was egg drop which was velvety, creamy and filling. •_We also orderd that infamous onion pancake which is one of the best I've had. •_Brown rice all around and good fortune cookies and fried sesame dough balls for dessert. •_Nourishment in food and friendship.",na
"Love this place!! Great service, good food choices, frosted beer glasses. You can even order online with your phone!",na
"This place is always busy. Love the interior. Open kitchen. I recommend making a reservation. We had a little bit of wait even with a reservation for 7. We were seated at a large table in the middle of the restaurant. Plenty of room for more people. The waitress was very attentive and fast. We ordered bang bang chicken wings, calamari, pork belly bun sliders, wild boar scissor cut noodles, mushu pork, fried rice, lamb dish, Peking duck and chili lobster. Most items were small portions. I didn't really care for the wild boar scissor cut noodles. It was sort of bland. Everything else were tasty",na
"The service we got here ONE time deserves two stars. My man's dish never came out, she never put in the order. She thought our appetizer was his dish, if that was the case why did one come out 15 before the second one?! This lady I will say barely spoke English and should not have been waiting on tables. She screwed up the table next to ours several times and they started getting loud. When they found out she screwed our order up too they laughed and commented. This table started getting racist and it pissed me off so I said everything was fine. This bad experience just happened once, very rarely will you have a a server that does not speak ANY English.The food here is amazing and the price is more then worth it. This is probably the best Chinese food I ever had in the city. With the combination of a nice atmosphere and good prices I am now a loyal regular.",na
The food was very clean for Mexican food. Filet Mignon was great! A friend introduced us to the Pizole and it was delicious! Fresh corn tortillas with an array of salsa temperatures. Definitely will be back!,na
"I was recommended Tai Chi for delivery and decided to try it out for myself. •_The delivery is free after a minimum $15 order, so ordering it for an individual meal will be too much. •_The food is very fresh and delectable compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area, and you can really taste the technique and freshness of each bite. •_The only downfall is that in delivery, please remember to order a side order of rice, as what you order is exactly what you get.",na
"I have been here a few times and am confident to say that this is one of the better places to eat in Chinatown. •_The quality is great and the prices are reasonable.Many people reviewing this restaurant have praised the seafood claypot, and rightly so. •_There were generous portions of succulent squid, scallops and shrimp and it was overall, quite yummy. •_We also tried the braised tofu clay pot, fried pea sprouts with garlic, ginger crab, and salt and pepper pork spare ribs. •_While these dishes weren't nearly in the same league as the seafood claypot dish, they were still very solid options.Service was fine and we ended up paying $17.50 for a tasty, yet filling meal.",na
"This restaurant recently replaced another similar type of hole in the wall but they dressed up the space a bit and simplified the menu to mixed results. It is a popular spot now, usually I see a line out the door and it has typically taken me at least 5 - 10 minuets of waiting in line to order. There is seating but it is really limited and if you are coming in a large group I wouldn't expect there to be much of a chance to sit down together. The food itself is mediocre though. This area is in great need of a good but simple burrito/Mexican restaurant but this isnt it. The food is REALLY white washed, if you are looking for authentic Mexican food skip this place. That said their version of the California burrito is ok, it has tater tots instead of fries. It isnt very flavorful though. I dont like crazy spicy food but I expect a burrito to have something interesting going on that stands out. I have had it a few times and usually the first few bites are enjoyable but then it really starts to become bland halfway into eating it. With that in mind I went there to try something else and went with a wet burrito which is the same as a regular burrito but with some enchilada sauce on top. I was hoping the extra sauce would make it stand out a bit instead of suffer from being bland like their California burrito. After a 5 minute wait in line I ordered it to go and went across the street to the market to pick up some juice and fizzy water. Once back I continued to wait for my burrito for another 15 - 20 minutes. The place was busy, maybe a tick more than usual. When they called my name they handed me a bag with my burrito and I headed home. Got home and discovered they only gave me a regular burrito and skipped the enchilada sauce so I wasted an extra $1.50. I gave the regular burrito a shot and it too was really bland (I ordered it with carnitas). I gave up halfway through and wont be back again.If you hate spicy Mexican food, tend to like the ""Tex Mex"" kind of fare and dont mind a long wait this isnt a bad option. Prices are reasonable for SF (about 10 bucks for a burrito) and the service while slow is friendly. Personally I am going to continue to have to travel out of the neighborhood to get my Mexican food fix.",na
Don't try and make a group reservation... they don't want your business. •_Needed to book a group of 12-14 for a Friday night. •_Called 5 weeks in advance and the woman who answered said it wouldn't be a problem but I had to speak to a manager who was in a meeting. •_Took my info and no one called back. •_2 weeks later I called again... same deal with the manager being in a meeting and they would be getting back to me. •_I explained that if I didn't receive a call I'd be taking my business elsewhere. •_No call again! Booked a reservation for 12 at Pane e Vino in the Marina in 2 minutes. •_Their manager wasn't in a meeting and they seemed to actually want the business. •_I don't see this location being in business for much longer with the poor management they have in place.,na
"The Dish: Forget Chinatown dim sum. This place has it all. It is on the pricier side and they realize that many of its customers are business/working people. Instead of what I'm used to (waiting for the carts to roll around), the waiters have mini-microphones to tell one another what customers want so the cars come to us. I came with my co-worker who knew all the good dishes. I typically only order shu-mai and shanghai dumplings. I know, no variety. But, here, I had maybe 6-7 different dishes? Definitely finish off with the green onion cake w/ peanut sauce and coconut rolls. Ambiance: This place has fast service and really nice people. My coworker didn't know the name of the green onion cake so could only describe it. They came out with the wrong order and was really cordial about it all - and got us the right dish even with just descriptions. They have patio seating as well as inside seating. Good place to come with friends and share a bunch of different dishes.",na
"you will not find a better thin crust pizza anywhere else.Try the monte bianco pizza which is listed under ""special pies"" on their menu.it comes with a heapy dollop of mascarpone cheese in the middle.You smear this on top of the prosciutto and eat away.Its not something you see everyday, but the salt from prosciutto, combined with the buttery sweet mascarpone will not betray you. •_seriously.of course, all the other pizzas I've tried here are fantastic.but that monte bianco is so out of the ordinary that i must share it with you yelpers.want pasta?go for the lasagne or the pesto.pesto actually tastes like fresh basil. not jarred mediocre stuff.i wholeheartedly appreciate them for using such great ingredients, in great combinations. •_thank you.oh! i almost forgot.if you need some appetizer, try the caprese with BURRATA. •_not regular mozzarella. •_ask for it if the waiter does not offer it to you.HOOOLY.",na
"Bad. Taco. I was here about a year or so ago and don't remember hating it. Today it was just embarrassingly bad. Tasteless beef, bland hot sauce, gummy tortillas. It was about 12.30p on a Saturday and there were only about 4 other people here - seems every other place in the ferry building had lines out the door. Next time I'm at the Ferry Building, I'll get in one of those lines. Getting a bad taco ruins my day and ensures that the next day, I get to treat myself to one of my favorite taco joints, so yay for tomorrow.",na

"Yup - it's not authentic Chinese. •_I do like Chinatown too - but this is a block from home and is frankly better than any of the delivery places in this 'hood. •_My fiance and I went here for the first time last night and had the pot stickers (standard, but very good), sizzling rice soup (hadn't had it before and was very happy - needed some soy sauce to make it a little more flavorful, but loved that the veggies were so fresh and crisp!) and Mu-shu chicken (also very good, but I was VERY disappointed that it came with grocery store tortillas instead of the thin crepe-like pancakes). •_Overall, we'll be back because we ate dinner for $20, it wasn't greasy, and it's close to home.",na
"I cannot tell you how fabulous Perbacco is. Spent Saturday dinner here for 20 year anniversary and birthday celebrations. The day after, I feel like I am on some kind of wonderful drug /elixir hangover. The atmosphere and service are impeccable, and the food is sublime. I started with the fritto misto, and Mark had a salad with kumquats and cherries, which were both superb. The frito misto even had a thinly sliced fried lemon-a big surprise which I loved.For mains, Mark had the plate of short ribs and tenderloin. The short ribs were flavored with red wine and melted in your mouth. My pasta with veal and mushroom sugo, well, I can't stop thinking about it, it was that good. From now on, I will always order a pasta every time I come back to Perbacco, which will be very soon.Let's not stop here, moving on to dessert, I had the ricotta cheesecake with candied mandarines and rhubarb, and Mark had a dark chocolate mousse. There was a great selection of desserts, which makes me happy, cause I love a beautifully crafted and executed dessert. This is also the place for wine lovers. The wine list has a table of contents and is probably about 25 pages long.This truly is one of SF's finest for Italian (or any other) food. This will •_become our go-to place from now on for special occasions or just to grab a bite on Friday night. . Thanks Perbacco for a beautiful evening.",na

"This place was ... interesting.I came here a while ago for brunch. Perhaps brunch is not their best feature, but at least the staff here is EXTRA nice, very friendly and super enthusiastic to help you.I had a friend who required accommodations and they were very good about it as he had been there before. We sat at the comfy couches which were awkward for eating in general and had some decent food. I would say money for value there are much better Mexican places in the city and much better food.However, I think this place has a very unique atmosphere that you probably won't find at many other places. Many regulars are like family, and the staff treat them just like that. I probably wouldn't come back again for food, but hey maybe a drink or two?",na

"For months my hubby and I ate at Tacko once per week and it was always good. It does take a while to get your to-go order (sometimes 20 minutes +) but we didn't mind as we always run into a friend there and would have a beer while we waited. Food was always on point. Love the San Diego burrito. Unfortunately we moved and I don't get over there much anymore so when I can get in and pick up some burritos, it's a treat. •_And unfortunately my order has been wrong 75% of the time in the last year. It's usually chicken instead of carnitas. This has happened at least three times. It's happened so many times it's now a joke between my friends - weather or not the burrito will made correctly and if it will be chicken. Sadly there actually usually is always something wrong. Other times I will make an addition on the burrito which I have yet to receive. Tonight over half my burrito was a huge chunk of meat the size of my fist. You can tell in the food that the cooks are busy and just blatantly don't care. Disappointing as we used to love this place.",na
"This by far is my favorite Taqueria ever...The ingredients are really fresh! I love the carnitas and grilled chicken. The meat is seasoned to perfection (not overly so - allowing you to enjoy the burrito as a whole versus your whole burrito tasting like a marinade). I even love the boiled chicken...The tortillas they use (although I think they may have changed this recently) are really thin. When you reach the end of a Gordos burrito, you're not left with a clump of overfolded tortilla, as you are with so many other places. •_And when they roll this burrito, the tortilla only wraps around the filling once, like a perfectly rolled doobie!The staff is cool...these are local types. For example - one time I placed an order, and forgot to bring my wallet. Just as I thought •_the days of bodega/convenience store credit were over, he let me go, no charge! (this was back in late 90s) And of course I returned next time to pay...With the recent price hikes across the board, Gordos didn't raise theirs too much...Kudos to Gordos for that. The only thing I can say negatively at this location is that there isn't alot of seating... There a funny legacy that goes along with my family and Gordos. The first time I came here was with my Uncle, who introduced me to the place. I was just a tike, probably around 8 years old. So it was my first burritto and I was very picky and choosy about what I wanted in it. I was really averse to wet ingredients like guacamole and sour cream, and beans were out of the question. So I ended up getting a steak with rice burrito. My Uncle got a steak with the works. So we drive over to presido to eat the burritos by the cliffs and oh man I'm loving it. It was my first burrito and I was really enjoying it. But my Uncle was like - wtf, my burrito is dry... Turns out all the while he had my dry azz burrito and I, who was so against any exotic shit, had his delicious guac sour cream and bean loaded meal. A perfect example of my fickleness towards food as a kid for no good reason.Gordos open a branch in the South Bay - seriously a strategic location would be in Campbell",na
"Ahhh...September.Long remembered as the dreaded start of school, I now find myself loving September for that very same reason.The little bastards that get in my way on my days off are now locked up in the prison that is the public school system. •_September also brings out, in my opinion, the best weather SF has to offer. •_Fog blankets are 1/2 of what they were in summer, rain isn't quite here yet, and the temperature rarely cracks the upper end of 80 degrees. •_I don't quite love you yet September, but I am liking what I am seeing so far.The only thing that almost ruined my evening at Tommy's was the parking situation in the Richmond. •_Damn you rich. •_You are killing me with the limited parking. •_Anyways, after an evening at the beach, Tommy's hit the spot with some damn good tequila and some killer salsa to go with the chips. •_Mix that with the world's 2nd greatest guac and I likey.Buro.",na

He comes back to tell us, sorry I didn't put them in the order. Again. After doing this with our initial order. That was it. This place doesn't care, the servers, the back of the house, no one cares. They get enough neighborhood regulars it seems like they do fine, but they clearly just want to crank out mediocre food as fast as they can and dick around in the back.",na
"I've never actually been inside the Wok Shop Cafe, but by hands down found this the place to have the best Take Out/Delivery Chinese in San Francisco! •_No MSG is one of the main reasons, and all of the food is very ""clean"" tasting without any additional oils. •_Always fresh. And chicken dishes very moist. •_Two of my favorite dishes are the Honey Walnut •_Prawns, and the Chicken with Asparugus in bean sauce. •_If you order sweet",na
"My first thinking about DELIVERIES means NO GOOD. •_They are only for neighborhood lazy ppl (like me) •_So, I never order chinese food... cause I am chinese and I know that no chinese fast food deliveries is good. •_They are cheap, greasy and you just don't have confident about their quality of meat.(turnover) •_I had a few hit/misses here, but they are pretty decent, but unconsistent. •_Sometimes, their food can taste incredible gordon bleu chef's style, but sometime is not eatable!!! •_(either too flavory or too spicy or salty) •_I never manage to call back to complaint",na
Fishermen stew is for real. Abundant amounts of seafood including clam mussels cod shrimp scallops in wine tomato sauce all in hearty serving..worthy!,na
"Hands down the best pizza in the area. Get the victors special. Get a salad too, they serve it with warm pizza dough bread. Excellent with butter. Pasta/entrees are good. Not like my Sicilian Granma made but there's no one that can make sauce and pasta like Nonna, still this decent Italian food. Sandwiches are good too. I usually get the Italian combo with minestrone which tastes homemade. Overall good food for not too much money and speedy delivery.",na
"I actually really enjoyed the food AND I had extremely high expectations. •_To me, that says a lot. •_Probably the most memorable part of my night was that the atmosphere truly reminded me of Florence. •_I have to be honest that my very positive association with Florence may have impacted my opinion of this restaurant. :) •_Regardless, the place is quaint and adorable with a romantic candle lit feel.My only negative comment is that the wait staff was straight out rude. •_Although one could say this adds to some Florence dining experiences as well....",na
Claypot catfish 3 yelps small portion but tastyPea sprouts and garlic 4 yelps very tasty small portionSteamed oysters with black bean sauce 4 yelps slightly over cooked.Salt and pepper fish 3 yelps slightly soggy but tastyWhite rice $1.50 per person mehhh Service was rushed but they want to turn the table multiple times a night.Yes It's a bit of a sketchy area just make sure your out before it's dark.,na
"Ahhh, Tai Chi.Good memories with this place when I lived in SF for two years.I'd recommend it for nights where you don't have time to cook and just want a hearty Chinese meal. •_It's not classically done - if you put Panda Express and a Classic Chinese restaurant in a blender, you'd get Tai Chi.Reliable, quick service (they deliver within 15 minutes - what the hell?)and flavorful (sometimes too much)...Enjoy!",na
"You will not be disappointed.In the culinary world of San Francisco, you have to be a giant to even perform, much less thrive.Acquarello does the job and does it well. We came here for the last night of our honeymoon after eating at some of Napa/Sonoma's finest during the week. This was by far our favorite meal. Granted, we splurged. We had champagne, wine pairings, multiple courses...and we didn't regret a bit. My only complaint for the night was that it took longer than desired for our server to greet our table and take our first wine order. After that the service was flawless. The sommelier was attentive and gave excellent suggestions for each of our courses. The little aperitifs provided between courses delighted us. The cheese course- absolutely divine. Don't miss it. They bring a large tray of cheese to the table and allow you to select your tasty bites. All in all, this was an absolutely heavenly experience. The icing was the truffle service at the end of the meal where we were able to select homemade truffles to end our meal (yes, after dessert). Perfection.It's the little things that count. The little things make you willing to drop $600 on dinner and feel great about it.Don't miss Acquarello.",na
"I've been both at this location and the one downtown and from my experience, Delarosa is a hit or miss. Both in service and in food. The pizza is always a safe bet, I would say, but I also tried their pasta once and it was a joke. Super small portion and nothing memorable. Their burrata bruschetta is apparently THE THING, but I haven't come around to try it yet. Another reason why Delarosa isn't top of mind for me, is their service. They do an ok job, given that it's pretty busy here. But I can't help but feel like an obligation, not a guest. You are seated at large tables with other guests, which I don't really have a problem with, but here you don't have any privacy at all. Way too close to your neighbor. And this all adds up to a really noisy atmosphere that makes it really hard to follow your own conversation. If all else fails, I'd be back to Delarosa, but will first make sure that there really aren't any other options nearby.",na
Been coming here for about 5 years for •_dinner with my family the food was great! and awesome service the waitress was very helpful. Recommend the cheese bread!,na
"This place exceeded my expectations for a to-go dim sum place. Definitely looking forward to coming back soon. •_+ Good quality food. Was in the store for 5-10 minutes and at least three trays of food was brought from the back of the store to the window displays for refill. They brought out the food as fast as people ordered, so my assumption is that the food is pretty fresh when ordered instead of just sitting around for more than a few minutes+ Good service. The people there were helpful and not rude, which is a big plus to me (non-Chinese speaker). Have encountered my fair share of lacking customer service but did not notice it here. Changed my order a few times, asked to have some food items separated in packing (sesame balls away from sticky rice), and did not at all feel rushed.+ Good prices. Girlfriend and I were stuffed and had small leftovers for under $20.",na
"I used to really like this place, until I saw their most recent health score. 68/100. That is ridiculously poor. I really saddens me to see restaurant owners who do not care about the quality of their food.",na
"We had dinner here a few weeks ago,after making reservations a few months previous. After all write-ups and awards that this restaurant and chef has received , there was no way we were going to try to get seated without a reservation. The quoted wait time when we arrived was over an hour. We were seated immediately, but it seemed to take awhile for anyone to come to our table. Once a server came by, she was worth the wait. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, and had great suggestions. She totally sold us on the pastas. We were also glad she let us know that the pastas were small portions, and advised us on how much we should order. Although this place is known for their pizza, we weren't that impressed with it. It was good, but I've had better. What did totally blow us away was their pastas! Wow, they were AMAZING! The pastas were very well thought out, creative, fresh, and totally delicious. I would come back for any one of them, but would skip the pizza. Service was pretty good, and prices aren't bad for the quality of the food. My biggest complaint was the bathroom. It was kind of gross. Not at all what you would expect from a restaurant like this. If you can get a reservation, I highly recommend it. The pastas are truly something special.",na
"Food was standard Mexican, service flat-out sucked.The guy they have assembling the orders doesn't speak any English. At all. Neither did he appear to understand my Spanish. I asked for my usual: rice, refried beans, pico de gallo, and flour tortillas to go. Apparently no one has ever ordered this because it seemed to confuse him greatly. There was an issue with the sizes, then he kept attempting to toast the tortillas when I kept saying I wanted them cold (they congeal into one if heated before being wrapped). Then when it came time to pay, I was charged nearly $14! For some miniature sides! And they don't even give free chips. It may have been a mistake, because she lowered the price to $9 (still too much IMO) when I mentioned that the rice and beans were both a small.There's some interesting decor inside, but on the night I visited, the air was thick with smoke. Perhaps they'd recently burned something, but if this was the case it sure took a while to dissipate. I returned hours later to use their restroom and still couldn't breathe.The food, once I'd taken it home and reheated it, was pleasant enough. Not outstanding, but there was nothing to complain about.",na
Great if you're ready to wait 30 minutes for your comida. Check in with the waitress after 15 min because they'll likely forget about your order.,na
"Barbacco is our office's go-to restaurant for all things catering. They are always super reliable, on-time, and friendly. Their catering orders arrive nicely packaged and our guests always rave about the food. They are also great for working lunch meetings or any last minute lunch requests. You can place a lunch order at 11 for a small group of people and it'll be ready for pickup in 30 minutes. The staff is a pleasure to work with, from the people running the takeout counter, to the delivery men who graciously unload all of the catering dishes for us. Our favorite dishes are: - Kale and roasted squash salad- Lasagna Bolognese- Farrotto - one of my FAVORITE dishes ever, creamy delicious farro, jam-packed with mushrooms. - Polpette- Braised chicken thighs- Focaccia - by far the BEST focaccia I've ever had outside of Italy. Super squishy and oily without being greasy. So delicious! I've never actually dined at Barbacco, but given that their food is incredibly delicious outside of the office, I'm sure it's an even better experience dining in!",na
"Am I missing something? Is it because I don't order a fully-loaded anything, ever? Is that also why I don't think Farolito is all-that either, because I don't order the Super Suiza Quesadilla at 2 am? But, still, I shouldn't need to order all-out to have it be pretty darn tasty. The chicken is drained from a vat of orange grease and I start to wish I'd ordered carnitas as they look more flavorful and an order of magnitude lower on the grease scale. Love that I have a choice for my tortilla (regular, whole wheat and I think, spinach).The service is really solid though, always friendly and fast. The burritos seem to be a pretty good deal, too. I mean, I get two meals out of six bucks!?! Hard to beat that. Chips are *not* included with your burrito and for that I am thankful! It's all too tempting. Salsa ranging from negative-spice, positive-salt pico de gallo to deceptively spicy, creamy green tomatillo salsa.Convenience of this spot is key and I know I'll be back. It's a good deal for dinner and I'm pretty set on trying something off the extensive seafood menu next time. Maybe even their fresh squeezed juices. Carrot, anyone?",na
Horrendous service. If you get a server named Bruce ask for another table. Tried to be cute but ended up being condescending. Took an hour for our orders to come out. Unacceptable. Disappointing.,na

"Location: in the beautiful and busy North Beach; I've never driven here (nor do I want to with those hills!) but it's probably a 5-7$ uber ride from Montgomery Bart. I've gone twice - once on a weekday lunch and it was dead silent. Once on a weekend brunch and I'm pretty sure I almost went deaf. It is SO loud and rowdy and most people around you are on their 6th cup of bottomless sangrias.. Service: pretty good at checking in and giving recommendations; you can leave your name and walk around, they will call you so you can show up within 5(i think) minutes to claim your table! Food: I think they recently changed their hours to no longer serve weekday lunches (really sad because their elote GAVE ME LIFE). Shrimp + carnitas tacos are both freaking out of this freaking universe. Chips and salsa are amazing too. I love you don pistos. I'll be back.",na
"I'm confident this place will move up to 5 stars after a few more visits. •_We visited for breakfast and had fantastic brunches - huge portions of tender pork, fried eggs, beans and rice, washed down with hibiscus juice. •_Will be back for dinner + sangria. •_It's the perfect Mexican restaurant - lots of flair, friendly people, great salsa, fresh tortillas, affordable, jukebox-full-o-Mexican-tunes. •_If there is a better Mexican restaurant in the city, I haven't found it.",na
"Heads up--- CASH ONLY, they have an ATM inside, but theres a Wells Fargo across the street in Safeway.I love this place! I've been coming here for at least 7 years. They know what i want, without me having to be specific. They have great steak burritos. Yummy! I always order a Steak Burrito with x-tra cheese, Pinto beans, salsa liquido, cilantro, avocado",na
"Positive: •_Very good sausage pizza. •_Stick with the pizza and you will be okay.Negatives: •_Wife order squid ink pasta with clams. •_Very weird, strong taste of some herb. •_Fortunately waitresses took it back with no argument. •_Wife asked waitress to bring a pasta that she thinks is good. •_The Maccaronara showed. •_It was edible, but reminded me of the canned spagetti I ate many decades ago.Special that night was trout salad. •_Not good.Restaurant is pricey with 3 of the 4 items pretty bad. •_Vastly overrated.",na
"The service here is bad enough that it doesn't matter whether or not the food is good.Something about having your waiter scowl at you, avoid eye contact, hurriedly toss food onto your table, and even greedily pick up the tip at the end (instead of waiting for us to leave their nearly-empty restaurant at nowhere near closing time) just doesn't make me want to ever come back.Also, almost no vegetarian options? In San Francisco? You've GOT to be kidding.(I'll toss 'em an extra star for having fresh ingredients, but that's all I've got.)",na
"Awful customer service. Waited more than an hour for a table of four when we were 4th on the list. Table of 5+ that came after us were being seated before us, which happened multiple of times. There were also smaller groups of 2 and 3 that came after us and were seated before us. Unbelievable!!!",na
This is the good place if you want to go to hotpot. Everything is very good. The service is good. The food and the watermelon juice are fresh. I strongly recommend •_ my friends to try it.,na
2 stars when I'm sober. 3 stars when I'm drunk. Okay for a quick drunchie craving if convenient. Food is okay. Bit greasy. Lackluster compared to other Taquerias.There's quite a bit of seating. It's pretty dirty. The grounds uneven so don't trip if you are in heels or messed up!I ordered a lengua burrito and it was okay.,na
"Nothing to complain about here but nothing over the top either. Service was o-k, not bad, but not great - It was fleet week so it looked a little busy, but we still got in with no wait so I'm not sure if that was the problem or not. Food wasn't spectacular but I had their signature (Cioppino, obviously) It was great except the calamari was a bit chewy. Will go back, just not with expectations being so high.",na
"So we found this place on Aaron Sanchez's show, Taco Trip. Of course you're in frisco so parking is a joke. We got in around 12 30 (make a reservation) it's slammed busy all the time. We were seated promptly and given menus. What bugged me is the other waiters and hosts just walk around and look at you like they're gonna help you, •_but they dont. Then the waiter comes, takes our order. We got food before drinks. The food was delish.Tropical tacos - jicama taco shells, pinko shrimp, aioli, and cilantro. BombBeef tacos - very bold flavor. Delicious tomatillo salsa to go with it. •_The negative is they don't ask how you are, they just rush you, •_by clearing plates, even if you're not done. They don't ask to take it, •_they just take it. •_Very cocky if you ask me. But yeah, good food, loud place, crappy service. Other than getting your food quick, they don't ask you how the food was, or if you would like another drink. Overall delicious time. But service is awkward.",na

place is kinda hidden but once you find it its worth it. they have bottomless mimosas and margaritas. menu inst huge but it has enough of a variety for everyone to chose something on. we found the place online from good reviews and it was everything we expected. customer service was good as well. 9 drinks •_and 3 food orders for $150bucks not too bad. i will deff come back one day.,na

"As an Angeleno with a constant craving for tacos, I was pretty excited to get some Mexican food in the Mission. I met a friend at Taqueria Cancun for a weekday lunch, and ordered up a trio of tacos. I enjoyed the place, and the food was fine, but I wasn't terribly impressed. Cancun couldn't hold its own against the tacos I have at home on the regular.The space was fun, casual and cheerfully decorated, with a kind of effortless appeal and easy atmosphere that marked it as pre-tech boom Mission. Service was quick and friendly. We ordered at the cashier, paid up (cash only), and waited for our numbers to be called. Seating was plentiful.The complimentary chips and salsa were pretty great--crunchy, fresh tortilla chips and chunky, •_flavorful red and green salsas. I ordered three tacos, a super taco with carne asada, and two regular tacos, al pastor and cabeza. All three came on soft tortillas with onions, cilantro, and salsa; the super added cheese, avocado, and sour cream. I was definitely into that super taco, and I enjoyed both the carne asada and the al pastor. The cabeza was kind of gross--definitely the squishy, mushy side of the cabeza spectrum, so I wouldn't recommend it if you only like cabeza half the time (I feel like I had a good cabeza run until Cancun, so I guess I was feeling lucky). I also just didn't find anything special about the tortillas or the quality/flavor of the meat. It all tasted good enough, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.I'll have to try some more Mexican food next time I visit the Mission. I liked my lunch at Taqueria Cancun, but it didn't step up as a San Francisco taco champion. I can think of a half dozen Los Angeles taquerias off the top of my head that would blow this place out of the water.",na
"We thought we had a reservation, but it was never made. Thye asked us to take a seat outside while they worked to accommodate the two of us. We ordered a glass of wine and sat outside. Within 10 minutes they were able to find space for us at the bar, where we were able to watch the sous chefs. They were also very helpful with our questions regarding a few menu items. Our meal was absolutely fabulous. A little pricy, but well worth it.We highly recommend this restaurant.",na
"Stopped in twice during my stay in SFO, I had dim sum in the bar and it was very good, excellent service by the bar tender and the food was excellent. •_On my 2nd trip back I ate the in the dinning room and my experience was equally pleasant. •_I was there on business so I ate alone, but I appreciated the excellent food and prompt service. •_I will come back, hopefully with a larger crowd so I can enjoy the duck,",na
"Had an unbelievable dinner here. We were able to quickly sit down at a comfortable tall table in the bar, at 8 PM on a Friday night. Not bad for Valencia St! We started off with some guacamole, which was real fresh with pretty hefty chunks of avocado. I ordered two of the puffy tacos, carnitas and brisket. The meat was so tender and mouth watering. Extremely well crafted. The puffy taco shell was also uniquely delicious. Great texture and great flavor to go with the taco fixens. •_I also sampled the fried chicken that my brother ordered, it is surely a highlight of the menu. I've heard that the queso is incredible here, and I'll certainly be back to try it!",na
"Thought it would be the perfect lunch for the day when we visited SF. They have a lot of high ratings and convincing reviews about their handmade flour tortillas. It is just 2 blocks away from 16th St. Mission BART station and we arrived around 2PM. It was a quiet joint and you will feel relaxed with the silence and dimmed lights. But after 10 mins, people came in out of nowhere and it was packed. It has a narrow space with lots of tables and chairs close to each other. You will have a basket of complimentary chips with Tomato and Habanero salsa. Crispy and not greasy. The salsa taste fresh. We ordered the Platillo Maya, Poc-Chuc and a free dessert of the day in which you could get upon check-in. We are looking forward for their Caramel Flan but it's not available. They have 2 desserts to choose from and we chose the Fried Bananas with Ice cream.Platillo Maya (Appetizer Combo for $10) - Handmade Tortilla cooked in 5 different ways. You'll get 1 Empanada, 1 Tostada, 1 Salbute, 1Kotzito and 1 Panucho. The Empanada is stuffed with ground pork and tomato sauce and was deep fried. I was not a fan. The tortilla is a bit thick and not enough filling to make it balanced. The Tostada is my favorite of all. The corn tortilla was crispy and complements well with the black bean puree and queso fresco. I don't like beans but the black bean puree was an exemption. The Kotzito is rolled and fried tortilla that was smothered with tomato sauce and queso fresco. It has the same taste with Empanada but the tortilla has a hard texture. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be hard or just crispy. Nonetheless, not a fan. LOL. I wasn't able to taste the Panucho and and Salbute but hubby said that the taste was ok. Overwhelming at some point. I guess it's just too much tortilla for the day!!! haha! •_Poc-Chuc - (Grilled Citrus Marinated Pork for $12) - You will get 3 big sized Grilled Pork, grilled red onions, shredded cabbage and bouillon rice. The pork was succulent, full of unimaginable flavors and refreshing. It was a taste of rainbow in my mouth on every bite during Pride day. Haha! I was so happy because I was so hungry and the food didn't disappoint. The grilled onions were the perfect side dish along with the citrusy taste of the pork. Don't you forget the perfectly cooked bouillon rice.Free dessert - Fried Bananas with Ice cream. We have 2 yelp accounts. Hubby and me. I was expecting that we could get 2 free desserts because we have 2 coupons to claim. We showed the server that we have 2 coupons and it was a very awkward conversation. He then gave us one. But it was all good. The dessert is big enough for one person anyway.......and...It's FREE! LOL.Quality and quantity of food is here. Inexpensive. The service was fast but they are understaffed. They have one server who runs around and dropped some of the plates at some point. Goodness gracious, give this man a huge tip!!!",na
"I've been coming to this place for 20+ years when traveling, and have never had a meal that was not terrific. The waiters use handhelds to take your order, and the food comes out super fast. The plates are large, very fresh, and always very tasty. The salads are outstanding. They used to have a pappardella dish years ago that was possibly the best pasta I ever had. Sadly this came off the menu, but their offerings today are nearly as good. Even the bread is great.Apologies to those who think this place is mediocre, but I think it's top notch.",na
"Korean food disguised in Mexican Style! FOOD: At first glance, it may look like a Mexican joint, BUT it's not. Basically, the outside looks Mexican, but the inside is Korean. They offer a variety of different dishes including: burritos, tacos, saucy burritos. rice bowls, salads, curry, cheese-steaks, po'boys and sides. My friend and I both ordered burritos: + grilled chicken kimchee/bulgogi burrito: all their burritos come with brown rice! YES! YES! YES! (screams the salubrious me), kiwi, kimchee (obviously), daikon and just a dab of sour cream and meat of your choice. Both the chicken and the beef were marinated nicely and very flavorful. The use of brown rice and fermented veggies with kiwi is the perfect amalgamation that creates a ""lighter"" but delicious burrito. SERVICE: Luckily, we arrive before the rush and didn't have to wait in line. The burrito came out literally 2 minutes I ordered it. And was very fresh! Utensils, cups, take out boxes are self served. Staff is also very friendly there! AMBIANCE: Diner style with lots of enacted single seats in the front and regular tables in the back. Very clean and brightly lit. There is also a bathroom in the back. Verdict: I will be back to try their maybe items. Only downfall is it's so far away from me!",na

"Dim sum was good. Not the best I've had but good. Make sure to get there real early or later on weekends. Got there at 9:30a, half an hour after they opened and still ended up waiting 1.5 hours even though the door hostess said ""20 minutes."" Ok decor and ambiance.",na
"We just missed brunch by a few minutes after 2pm on a Saturday afternoon at the Doctor's Lounge, and I was surprised to see an El Farolito this close by, so decided to eat here instead as I was a huge fan of the El Farolito •_just off the 24th St Mission BART station. This place didn't disappoint as it satisfied my hunger and food cravings. My friend got their Carne Asada super burrito, and I got their chicken super quesadilla. Both orders were huge and extra filling with extra guac and sour cream. It tasted just as delicious as I remembered. Prices still remained cheap, under $10 for the super portions and under $8 for the regular portion.",na
Probably the best Sicilian style pizza you will find in SFB.Good variety of toppings and fast service.,na
"Their siu mai is huge and each bite into it is like juicy pork raining down on you. If I lived near here, I would probably be getting fat off of siu mai every day. I also got turnip cake and custard buns which were okay. The turnip cake was slightly burnt and I overestimated my ability to eat that much turnip cake in one sitting. Getting 3 siu mai, 3 turnip cake, and 3 custard buns only set me back about $7. Bang for your buck.When I came at around 1 PM, there was a line snaking its way out of the store of around ten people. Frequent people who come here are probably people who work nearby in the FiDi area and tourists.",na
"If you are a Latino this is the worst place you can go. It is over priced and barely has meat on their burrito.Si eres latino es el peor lugar para ir, los precios son altos y un burrito casi ni trae carne, un sê_per burrito •_del size de un breakfast burrito from McDonalds. El peor burrito q he comido en la mission!!",na
"I went back to this restaurant for the second time last week after a great first experience some months ago and they did not disappoint. We had a tight schedule and not much time to eat in so I called ahead to ask if they thought it would be reasonable to get fed within the hour. The host was gracious and said she'd reserve a table for us so that it'd be ready on arrival. In an effort to accommodate us, they got food to the table quickly - with no compromise to great service or food. I am particularly in love with their funghi pizza but everything was spot on. Feels like a hidden SF gem.",na

"The dark atmosphere and red lighting really complimented the pitcher of fresh fruit margaritas. The tone was just right. It's the kind of place you go with good company and get lost in conversation. The booths are rounded so you feel like you have your own private corner. The overall vibe is cozy.Excellent food! Home made chips? SO good. Thick and crunchy and not salty, perfect. I ordered Cornbread Sopas, yum as well. My friend and I both had this pile of pink cabbage garish on our plates...even if it was just garnish I ate every piece of it. What was this delicious surprise?!We got there on a Monday night evening 5 the place was empty. The crowd started to pile in while we were leaving.",na
"I love this place so much. Capannina feels like an escape to Italy - all of the food is absolutely delicious, and the waiters are very charming and attentive. I've been here many times and have nothing but good things to say about it. Great spot for a date (might be a bit crowded for a big group though).",na
"Was there the other night. Reserved a table for 10. The restaurant is kinda small, so make sure you make reservation if you have a big group. Not sure why they close at 9:00 pm every night, so be there early as well. The food is way better that what I expected for a small restaurant out of no where, and the price is great. Could not find a dish that costs more than $10, and they have their own parking in the city!!! For sure will go back and try the other dishes.",na

"My husband and I treated another couple to dinner to thank them for being great hosts during our SF trip. •_We'd never been to Firenze, but a local friend had recommended it. •_Our friends arrived early. •_When we joined them, we were shocked to learn that the host refused to seat them and had asked them to wait outside in the cold, windy night until the rest of our party arrived. •_That's no way to treat new customers! •_It was a weeknight and the place was half-full.Firenze's poor hospitality put a damper on the rest of our evening. •_The gnocci was tasty, not sublime, and the spinach salad and bruschetta were good. •_However, the decaf coffee tasted bitter and looked like mud, even when I asked for a fresh cup. •_You can do better for your money.",na

"Another totally dissapointing entry in SF's take out Chinese scene. I used to order from this place every once in a while when I lived in the Mission and while I could stomach it, I was never excited. I liked the *idea* of it, but not the execution. Only thing I can remember enjoying (but only slightly) was the Mu-Shu.",na
"You have to order first before you can get seated and everyone in your party has to be present. It's also cash only. The dumplings definitely make up for the bad service. I felt like the server was a bit rude specially when we were ordering and trying to get seated. It did get better after we were seated though.We ordered the pan fried pork buns, Shanghai steamed dumplings, the crab",na
"Yelp Check in offer: free hugs from David or Jay. Well, if that doesn't set the tone for the experience, then I don't know what will. This tiny hole in the wall is Korean/Mexican fusion as the name implies. They serve different kinds of meats in their burritos, tacos, quesadillas, and tater tot nachos - to be labeled as ""totchos"" from here forth. The first time we stopped in was our first day in San Francisco. I was beyond floored when I saw bulgogi on the menu and then how they were using it. Bulgogi... in traditional Mexican dishes? Win. We ordered a plate of bulgogi totchos to split and they were mothgasmic. Explosions of flavors layered with perfectly crisp tater tots. There was no skimping on toppings, either. Every single bite had every morsel of flavor in it. Truly amazing food experience. We came back our last night in town, ordered the same totchos, the California burrito with bulgogi, and bulgogi totchos. It was way too much food for 2 people, but we powered through and suffered the discomfort of being overly stuffed for a few hours. Worth it!",na
"Went here because the Yelp menu had good prices, but this place is actually way over priced! A veggie burrito is now $7, totally ridiculous!",na
This is my go to Chinese restaurant in the sunset. Price is reasonable. I've been coming here for years. Food hasn't change. Lunch menu is great value.,na
"Okay, as everyone saying this is mostly take out place. But I needed a lunch atm, and I usually would look for 4.5 or 5 stars in the area, but there were nothing above 4.This was one of these 4 star places.I hesitated a bit, but decided it maybe not that bad.I ordered curry chicken on rice.Well, I did not finish my plate. •_Everything was good, except chicken.There were sinew's and fat served in plate. To me it's not acceptable, but I can see how this place could be good for someone who likes fat and sinew's, because, well if you like THAT in your food, then you would like this place.",na
"I would give 3 or 4 stars because the food is not bad at all. We quite enjoyed everything we ordered. Started off with the black vinegar marinated peanuts.. very good. Perfect with beer. We ordered white wine cava instead and for $8 is overpriced for the small glass you get. We shared small plate of tiki pork belly, which was good. Very fatty though but I like that haha. My partner ordered the westlake rice porridge, which was not my favorite. Way too much cilantro, which overpowered everything. I wanted the thrice cooked bacon.. but they ran out of bacon! Yep this is partly why they get 2 stars from me. I don't think they ran out of bacon.. I think it was almost closing time and they didn't want to make this dish that may take longer to cook. (I ended up ordering the lamb face noodle soup, which was good. The lamb esp was delicious).To explain further my low rating. There was a couple there who waited 45 minutes but when their name was called, the hostess could not read the lady's name (yes ""Ellen"" is very hard to read.. I guess). So she crossed their name off the list and gave their table to someone else. So there's that. Why not have someone take down people's names? If you're going to have a policy of not seating people because you supposedly can't read their writing? I made sure my name was legible by the way! I think that Saturday night the hostess did a poor job of managing the wait list. I think she was eager to get rid of people from the list because like I mentioned it was almost closing time and there was still a huge line. When we were eating we saw the cook/chef/owner screaming with the hostess. Employees started leaving one by one. And the restaurant was still full. So 2 stars for the ghetto situation. Not something I would have ever expected. Don't show up here if it's after 9pm because you may not get seated until 10pm, and they close at 10:30pm.",na
"Good food, small, good portions, and good service. Got free tiramisu for checking in. Filet mignon was cooked nice and was tender. Had ravioli and a pasta with clams and mussells. Honestly, I didn't really like the pasta sauce. Waiter recommended a wine we drank which was good too.Our total came out to around $140 with tip.",na
"Food only tasted good because I was starving. I ordered a super nacho through Uber eats and the food came smelling like it was sitting in the fridge for a day or two. The rice and black beans didn't seem too fresh. I grew up on beans and rice so I'd have some idea. I might of been fresh but seriously, it smelled like a f$",na
"When the only thing u can rave about is the price, that's not necessarily a good thing. I'm really sorry if this review offends others who like this place. But this is SF, we have lots of asian restaurants that are much better than this place, so it merits only 2-stars.This is a true hole in the wall with only a few coveted counter seats available. I love how this tiny space has survived for many decades. Somehow all these years, the 2 older asian women manage to greet and handle customers, take orders, answer the phone, serve drinks (includes opening coconuts), cook, package to go meals, and wash dishes all day long. They are amazing!! so they get no complaints from me if on a rare occasion sometimes they appear to be grouchy.static.px.yelp.com/bphot_Ü_static.px.yelp.com/bphot_Ü_static.px.yelp.com/bphot_Ü_And I do remember that I raved about their house noodles and the rice dishes in the past when I was still a college student. Now that I'm older and hopefully wiser, food quality matters more. Yamo is just not that good. If u try many of their dishes, you'll taste the same horrible raspy sauce that's not even authentic. Sorry these night pics are not as sharp.static.px.yelp.com/bphot_Ü_static.px.yelp.com/bphot_Ü_static.px.yelp.com/bphot_Ü_Sorry Yamo, I won't B there.",na
"One of the best tacos I've had in my life, hands-down. I got the carne asada super taco and the carnitas super taco. I wish I could give the carne asada super tacos a 6/5 star rating because it went above and beyond my expectations. I've never had anything so delicious in my life. The carnitas didn't compare to the deliciousness of the carne asada but it was still good. My friend got a super burrito and my boyfriend got the enchilada and those were delicious as well. Line was long but it moves pretty quickly. They only take cash so be sure to go to the ATM beforehand if you don't want to be charged for ATM fees within the restaurant. Don't use the bathroom. Seriously, it's disgusting. So disgusting to the point that they even covered their health score.",na
"Fun spot and great service, with emphasis on seafood. Always nice to get a front seat at the chef's counter to watch the action. Tasty, though a bit heavy on the sauces.",na
"While the service was great, the food was not. •_Our pastas were luke warm and nothing exciting. •_We requested to dine upstairs, but had to eat in the wine cellar below. •_It would be a great place for tasting, but it felt removed and isolated from the rest of the restaurant. Based on how expensive the bill was, I would not return nor would I recommend it to friends.",na
"Puerto Alegre is a Mexican cafeteria with cocktails and the occasional mariachi. •_Sit near the front window and you will smell the street, ie, the pot. •_The quesadilla I shared there once tasted nice enough. •_When my friend ordered it again, it came closer to a panini. •_My chili relleno didn't hold any spice until the very end. •_It was also small and surrounded by a meager helping of beans and rice. •_Then again, I'd asked for the ""one item"" combo. •_Where's the food?",na
"I went to this place a couple of weeks ago. •_I thought the food was very good, but the service blew goats. •_I had a couple of antipasti (the salumi and the octopus with bean), and my friend had the ravioli. •_The octopus was delightful. •_Service was initially fine, but after we ordered and had some bread and tapenade, things went a bit off the rails.There were four other occupied tables and two waiters. and a guy who was doing the bread/water/busing (whatever that function is called). •_Our waiter came by to see how everything was, and took off before I was able to request more tapenade; we were out, but had plenty of bread, and I had put the empty dish on the outside edge of the table to be in plain sight for such an occasion. •_I called him back and he brought a half-filled dipping bowl. •_I started to ask for more right then, but didn't.When he brought the plates out the bread basket and tapenade were empty, and he didn't even ask if we wanted more of either. •_After waiting for a few minutes, thinking he would have at least asked the table guy to give us more bread, I signalled the waiter in vain, then went over to the table dude (who was busy clearing another table) to please bring more bread. •_This while our waiter was chilling, standing in clear view of our table.Whatever. •_I figure the guy was preoccupied with more important matters in his head. •_And we didn't order a bottle of wine. •_I'd give it another shot, as the food was a solid 4/5.",na
"Crowdy, loud and average food. Only good thing about it was the service.Went with my wife on the valentine day evening, even after reservation had to wait for aprox 30 min. I went there after reading yelp reviews, but was highly disappointed.",na
"Let me start off by saying that the service is absolutely ATROCIOUS. My friend and I walked into the venue and stood at the front for about 10 minutes before any of the employees realized we were there, at which point they finally sat us at a table. After doing so, they had not attended to us to ask if we wanted beverages to start off with. When we finally got their attention after sitting at the table for 10 minutes, we ordered hot teas and our entrees. I ordered the beef and broccoli with a side of steamed white rice and my friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken. They did not bring us water, nor asked if we wanted any. A little while later, they brought an entree, but it was neither of ours... they brought a chicken and Chinese broccoli entree. Eventually (10 minutes later), they brought out the correct entrees and the hot tea at which point we asked for water and the waitress brought it. I will not deny that the food was good. Mine entree was good, hot, but a bit on the smaller side. My friends entree was bit cold, but was good. Again, after the meal, we waited for 10 minutes and the waitress did not notice us, so I had to come to her and get her attention to bring us a check. I gave it to her instantly because I didn't want to wait for her to acknowledge us again... The food is great, but the service is beyond terrible... If you are patient, I would recommend; otherwise BEWARE.",na

"The waiter was extremely pushy, took our plates with the pricey crab cakes before we finished and accused us of there being nothing on the plate and THEN when he saw the crab cake in a bowl accused us of handing him the plate!!! Dude this place is a joke, everyone dropping everything and check your silverware, chances are there is food still on it!",na
The food here is horrible! All the familiar Chinese dishes did not taste the way they were supposed to. Everything was bland and all the dishes tasted the same. How do you make broccoli chicken taste the same as mongolian beef? I am perplexed. Never will I come here again nor will I ever recommend this place to any family or friend.,na
"Great choice for cioppino (tues night) if you're not around Sotto Mare. Gets busy but can call in an hour beforehand to get on the wait list (for up to an hour) - and you'll need it, even for a weeknight. Pass on the eggplant burrata (we're all just interested in the burrata anyway, right)? It's like the hot friend that's an 8 who's accompanied by his/her sad four. Sorry buddy, not happening. Little charred gem salad, •_alternative if you're bored of lacinto kale / arugula. What else...bartender was heavy handed with the lemon juice that night. Gnocchi? A smidge •_doughy, but can't hate on all that is fried (goodness).",na
"Decided to finally check out El Techo after months of friends telling me it's crackin. I came here with a friend after work right when they opened and even though it was drizzling and freezing, their rooftop was nice and cozy! They have happy hour from 4-6 M-F I believe and the food is so worth it! Their guacamole is bomb and so is their pollo frito. We also had a pitcher of sangria and their chicharrones but personally it wasn't to die for. The meat was a bit too sweet for my liking but everything else was yummy. We also got the ceviche which I could do without next time. Overall, our server was awesome. Actually service is general was great. Everyone was super friendly and they let us sit at a 4 person table even when we were only a party of two. I will definitely be back!",na

"I've been eating at Puerto Alegre since the early '80s and it hasn't changed much, except that my palate has gotten more sophisticated. If I'm only giving 3 stars why do I keep going back? Because I like being there. Valencia is my favorite SF street and I think Puerto Alegre is one of the only places still left from the old days (Taqueria El Toro and a few other restaurants are still there too). They do make a strong margarita - watch out for the high pitcher prices. P.A has the standard Mexican food you'll find everywhere, at reasonable prices, completely good enough to satisfy, but nothing to write home about. •_But hey, I just love being on Valencia Street.",na
Excellent. Each pasta dish is so complex and balanced! I can't believe it was that good!Beyond my expectations.,na
Accessibility (Parking / Wait Time)0/1 Star: had to pay a meter. But at least the meter was easy to find. The area isn't busy.

"Great food despite poor delivery. I was feeling a bit lazy and decided to order from here despite living close by, ordered through eat24. The food was out for delivery shortly after I placed the order. Unfortunately it took 40 minutes for it to travel 5 blocks and was tepid on arrival.The person whom I spoke with graciously explained the situation and reached out to eat24 on my behalf.The food was excellent after going in the microwave for 30 minutes. I will be eating here again soon.",na
The best hot pot place in San Francisco Bay Area.Great customer service and great food.,na
"The meat is stenchy, its not even one type. All the meat choices were stenchy. Service was slow and inattentive even those they're constantly walking around. Definitely not coming back.",na
"I live in San Mateo every time I go to san francisco I do not forget to go through the TASTE GOOD TAQUERIA excellent care of food preparation excellent burrito, tacos, tortas, quesadillas.tostado, chile rellenoI give them all 5 stars",na
Wow what a brunch. We toured all over the city looking for a good brunch place on our first visit to San Fran and we saw this one on Yelp. 15 min later on an Uber pool we got here and we had one of the best brunch food we ever had! My girlfriend and I got the American breakfast which was good but the crown jewel was the croissant french toast. Devine. Nothing can't describe how enjoyable was that experience.In a nut shell go there and order it!,na
"Sat at the wine bar and had a great dinner. Got some glasses of wine that were well recommended and were able to try a couple different types before deciding on which one to get. Pasta was thick and not overly rich which is always a plus, kept it light and right. We got the pizza as well, can't remember what the name of it was but was spicy with some choice meats on it! Again really tasty and fresh. This place is a hot little number for a date or casual wine bar. I suggest sitting at the bar if at all possible, always more fun.",na
"A delightful experience. Fun and tasty dim sum, from tame dishes like duck and yummy bok chow to more exotic, like chicken feet and jellyfish. I didn't have anything I didn't like. Good service, genuine food, and surprisingly good prices. Fed five hungry adults for $83. Recommend highly.",na
"First time trying deep dish pizza and WOW! Customer service was beyond excellent, we were very well attended to and loved the service. We ordered :garlic bread; scrumptious, mini pizza look a like, with cheese my garlic. Wings; were ok, wish they had a sauce. Deep dish; pepperoni with sausage, so delicious!We will most definitely we back soon!",na
I had the ceasar salad with sauteed calamari and tiramisu and some drinks the food wasn't special for north beach but acceptable along with the service see photos.,na
"I've had Deflina bookmarked for ages but never went. •_Why? •_Cause nothing pops out at me.My friend managed to get a last minute reservation before the holidays. •_Both of us were stuck staring at the menu and struggling with what to order.We tried their signature Calamari, Risotto, Duck, and Panna Cotta. •_Everything was pretty forgettable. •_Risotto and Panna Cotta are all acquired tastes. •_Both got nasty as I ate more. A 4% service charge is added to support SF employer mandates?! What is this?!I still get into debates as to whether or not to count this as a tip....this bothers me....esp since dishes are already pricey and small portioned.",na
"This place has some really delicious food. I order the chicken fried rice, General Tao Chicken and War Wonton Soup. Everything tasted fresh and light. None of the food was greasy. •_Found them on yelp",na
"Stopped in on a busy Sunday at lunch time and managed to get a table outside! •_I had the pescado tacos, very fresh tasting and delicious. •_My friend had the chicken tacos which she said were very good. •_The chips and salsa were ok, could've skipped them, but the agua frescas are a must! •_Yum!",na
"I really enjoyed my dinner here. They had some interesting selection of cheeses and I love the fixin's they give you with it (honey, jam, almonds, and some bread). Pizza was solid, and their boar lasagna was VERY tasty.It sounds like their happy hour menu is one of the best in town, so I'll definitely be returning to try that!",na
"PIZZA MONSTER APPROVED Get there fast and order the housemade sausage pizza before it's gone, every bite is amazing.",na
This place is NOT as good as it use to be. Te food is bland and they give very small portions. I use to really like them. The family and I went last night and no one enjoyed the meal.We ordered •_5 different items. The only the item we liked was the pigstickers.Szechuan eggplant w/prawns: had a nice flavor but the prawns were over cooked.Lemon chicken: small portion and soggyHunan Salmon: mainly consisted of onions,na
"I have heard great things about this place, so had high expectations when I tried it for the first time yesterday. On Fridays they have the 2 for $7 deal, which can't be beat! Everything we ate was delicious: the nachos, quesadillas and chicken and carne asada soft tacos. And a churro of course. I will definitely be back to Nicks and recommend!",na
"Starting with a 30 minutes wait is never good, but I didn't want to knock off any points for that.But unfortunately, A16 wasn't able to redeem itself with the food... the Pizza's were good, but not as nearly as good as the neighbor Delarosa.The Uni pasta was interesting, but nothing to run back to.For the price and praise, expected way more",na
"Got little star via door dash tonight. Showed up on time but luke warm. I quote my kid...""is this little caesars?""",na
"Definitely a place I would recommend for some basic essential Dim Sim. Would say it's not a place recommended to go if you are looking for a full selection, but for what they do they do it well. Looks like they don't do reservation only waiting list the list outside the place so be prepared to wait. From the fact that they do fresh dough to wrap the dumplings to the fact the it tastes so fresh you are in for a delight.Tips:1. Tom Yum Soup Dumplings - They come in a nice reddish color to the outer layer of the dumpling which has a nice sauce to complement the pork inside2. Shrimp and Chive Shu Mai - Jam packed is some juicy decent sized shrimp with some hints of chive to make it all have a nice decadent goodness3. Egg Yolk Bun - So fluffy and the egg tastes amazing. A great way to finish off your meal with a nice treat4. Tea - Not as strong and steeped with a tea bag it is a good way to cleanse while you are having your meal",na

"I head here for drinks after work from time to time. The clear best aspect of this place is it's large outdoor patio with a BAY VIEW. If you have lived in San Francisco long enough, you will be as shocked as I was to read ""big outdoor patio"" and ""water view"" in the same sentence. It's right by the Embarcadero, which means you will have some traffic noise. Still much better than yelling at your friends in a tiny, crowded bar!The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because the drinks are mid-range prices, and I love a great spot with less expensive wines/cocktails. If you're looking for a fun summer cocktail, I would try the Fresca (watermelon, rum, lime and sugar) -- divine!",na
"We were celebrating a special occasion, which we mentioned to our server Sarah who then made it a point to ensure that we two women had an exceptional evening. But it went beyond Sarah, from the minute we were greeted at the door every member of staff was super lovely.The food is the best both my foodie friend and I have enjoyed in a long time and recently we've dined at some pretty toney places that were disappointing. I have memories of the Jewish-style artichoke in Rome and Locanda's did not disappoint. The meatballs had us asking for additional delicious char-grilled bread so we could wipe the plate clean, and we did! The asparagus and blood orange was a sublime combo. We shared the Rigatoni all Carbonara - heaven in our mouths.We had the Italian sparkling to kick off the night and followed with the Costa Graia Cesanese Piglio Superior, which I'm still dreaming of today. My friend had affogato for dessert and I had a glass of Malvasia.Thank you, Locanda, for making my first day as an American truly memorable! We will definitely be back:-)",na
"I came here for cinco de mayo. Showed up 15 minutes before my friends and politely waited outside not putting my name on the list only for my friends to show up and ask if our name was on the list yet. Huge mistake.The wait was considerable, but made ever more pleasant by the atmosphere of San Francisco denizens loudly talking over eachother and over pitchers of margaritas and every once in a while cheering when the Maitre' D would read out a name several times loudly, get no response, and cross another name off the list of those waiting for tables.The marg pitchers here are a reasonable $33 for the house marg (I don't know what the other ones are but the house marg is good). The food here is good as well. Highly recommend coming here with a group and getting good and sloshed then scarfing down some quality mexican food. Sounds like a good time.",na
"Yummy margaritas. Since I never drink, it doesn't take much, and since these tasted like they had tequila in them, I had several and got pretty drunk :). Decent Mexican food, their chips were my favorite, though I've had better salsas at my neighborhood joint. The food is cheap, but the pitcher of maragaritas topped our bill off to over 50 bucks. Great ambiance and service too. Expect a wait; we got there and there were several groups waiting, but I overheard one of the servers saying that the manager didn't realize that there were people waiting, and then we all got seated at the same time.",na
"Back in the day, I used to hit this area of SoMa fairly often. •_Azie, the former occupant of this space, and Lulu, still there, were the popular and new eateries to frequent. •_Azie has long since been replaced by Zero Zero and now coming up to this area is about as easy for me as juggling, in other words not very easy.I was glad to finally be able to eat in the area, but being a holiday weekend and having some restrictions in terms of my dining guests meant that my options were limited. •_Although Zero Zero has nice continuous hours, their full dinner menu isn't available until 5:30 pm. •_Until then, they only serve their excellent pizzas and salads. •_Moreover, reservations are usually recommended and even the early hours were booked for the entire weekend. •_Luckily, we decided to stop by early and see whether we could sneak in before the main crowds. •_I wanted to try the pizzas but also wanted to try a few dinner items. •_The hostess was more than friendly and while she said she was going to put us on a waitlist (never sounds like a good thing), she also gave us a very realistic and reasonable estimate and before we knew it we were seated in a nice four top nearby the bar. •_The space looks completely different than the Azie I remember and the dark wood tones are hip and inviting. •_There's a second floor and the drinks are as good as the food. •_ Our order:Arancini - $9.50. •_Risotto filled deep fried balls filled with cheese and garlic. •_Five small round balls that are nicely fried and plated with some arugula. •_Tasty, but really bite sized.Hamachi Crudo - $15.95. •_Three slices of hamachi were plated with a combination of avocado, herbs, and oils. •_Fresh and tasty, but pretty pricey given the number of pieces.Squid Ink Bucatini - $23.95. •_The dark pasta was mixed with fresh tomatoes and mixed with uni butter. •_It actually was topped with two pieces of uni and the pasta was both al dente and flavorful. •_Some haven't liked this dish that much, but I thought it was done well.Castro - $19.95. •_The pizzas here are famous and Michael Bauer supposedly compares the pizza to French Laundry as the menu is proud to share. •_I like a meaty pizza so ordered the Castro with the sopressato. •_It's nicely thin crust and not too burnt and the cheese is bubbling and melted when it arrived. •_I thought it was very tasty and I enjoyed it immensely.Pimm's Ale - $11. •_I don't even really know what Pimm's is but I always like drinks mixed with it. •_More research has taught me that it's a popular English beverage and drunk at some events like polo tournaments and Wimbledon. •_I guess I was classy and didn't even know it. Overall, I was super happy that Zero Zero was able to squeeze us in. •_Our other option for the area was What's Up Dog and while I love mango lassi and hot dogs, I was hoping for something more. •_Zero Zero fit the bill. •_This is a great SoMa addition. •_The price point quickly adds up but both the ambiance, service, and quality of food makes up for it and makes for a great night out. (not an every day dinner though I saw many orders of pizzas to go ringing up at prices like $80-100)Zero Zero accepts credit cards, including American Express.",na
"went here for my friend's birthday celebration last night.we had a whole mess of people.. and so they placed us in our own private room - which was AWESOME ! wished they had karaoke tho!so the service was quite good! they gave us unlimited refills on Coke and Sprite... ( : the weekend Buffet Style dinner is $24.95 + our 18% tax n tip came out to be close to $32. Quite pricey.. but hey.. free soda + a private room = happy camper.on the weekdays its only $16.95. The only beers they have are Bud lite, Corona, and Heineken. side note : I LOVEEEEEEE eating mussels with heineken. they give you a 2 hour limit, but they're pretty lenient. they're conveniently located next to Crepe Temptation. which is awesome!the only con is that the room was steaming hot like a suana, and there was no ventilation except the open door!! they have this tiny dinky fan but my friend's butt was hogging it up. we were pretty uncomfortably hot in there.. w/ all the steam from the hot pots and the body heat and trapped air =[",na
"Looks like I have a new favorite burrito spot in town. I eat a fair share of burritos and have no plans to stop, and this place rocks it. Super burrito with carne asada: fresh quac and salsa, mexican rice, refried beans, solid steak under $10 in San Francisco? Yes please. Not much to add here, stop reading reviews and go to this place.",na
"Wish I had discovered this place when I still lived in San Francisco proper! In short: West of Pecos is a low-key but nice Latin American restaurant with flavorful, beautifully plated food.My favorites:-Fish tacos: a plate comes with 3 tacos. You can also ask for smaller portions as well--we got 1 extra so we could split evenly. The batter is crispy and light but well-defined, and the fillings are a crunchy slaw and tangy sauce, which complement the fish very well. (Pro tip: eat them fast or the corn tortillas will start to lose structural integrity from the slaw)-Maple brussel sprouts: I could eat these all day. I don't know what they put in this dish, but it is so comforting to eat. It is sweet yet rounded out nicely with a slightly salty/buttery flavor. Texture-wise, the sprouts are soft and minimally crispy.-Churros: this dish comes with 3 churros and 2 sauces. All I need is that caramel/dulce de leche sauce, though. Churros were crispy outside and soft inside, but a couple of time started imploding in my fingers. No worries though, because that caramel sauce is amazing.Worth checking out if you're looking for good food with a clean, rustic environment. Or if you just want a sangria and/or margarita. ;)",na
"BF knew I was a big fan for truffle so he brought me to this place for my birthday dinner. What a surprise! As soon as I walked in this place, Ooh la la! A snooty place! (just by what customers were wearing) However the bookcase at the entrance, the arches, the wood-beamed vaulted ceiling, even the decorated little corner at the end, softened the atmosphere at the same time. Of course, the warm and soft lighting was one of the big reasons as well. Being too stressful isn't a good way to enjoy my food. We both had ordered a 4-course menu so we could try the most famous flan-like Parmesan budino, the foie gras pasta scented with black truffles, Lobster panzerotti, Pancetta wrapped scallops and the duck entrê©e. All of them were so fantastic and I especially loved the duck entree. It melted in my mouth within seconds! I loved duck but there were not many places making a good dish. If they keep the duck on their menu, it will become my designated place for a duck dish. For dessert, we both have the Semifreddo. Wonderful! For this night, I had truffles, foie gras and the duck. It sounded more like a French menu. But I usually don't have a good luck with most French restaurants. I had better luck and better duck with Acquerello!",na
"Classic seafood in Fisherman's Wharf!Was spending the afternoon in the area and needed to find a place with some seafood. Found Cioppino (chi-peen-o) and were not disappointed. The service was great with our server, Ian, and the portions were good. We had to have the signature dish and the broth was so good, making all the seafood so tender and full of flavor. Also had two cups of chowder, courtesy of a Yelp Check-In, and were surprised at how filling it was. Super delicious, but you may want to reconsider your entree if you're having more than a cup of chowder.Definitely a great spot along the west side of Fisherman's Wharf and would definitely go back again.",na
"We finally get a reservation for 9:30 pm and in my opinion they should not take a reservation if they cannot serve items on their menu! •_They were out of bread (luckily we have already tried Tartine's bread) and then another pasta which someone in our group ordered had to be rushed to their kitchen lest they ran out:(Well, either reduce the menu prices by 1/2 or don't take reservations if you can't offer items on your menu that late!Ambiance: •_Not that great, a bit crowded! •_If you are charging that much for your menu items, seat your clientele so they are not within ear shot of each other!!!",na
"This was a major disappointment on several levels. First off, the margaritas aren't made with tequila (they only have a beer/wine license); so you know this didn't bode well. The sangria is cheap, but there's a reason for that. It's like kool aid with a few tiny pieces of orange in it. This continued the run of shitty sangria I've had in this town. Get a beer.The service was strange - the hostess/waitress was socially awkward, which is fine, but then maybe this isn't the best job for you.Onto the food. I will not heat here again. Why? They have raised their prices from what's listed on menupages - and for no good reason. The food was average or below. The prices were above. I'm no mathematician, but that doesn't add up. My chille relleno was drowning in a really watery sauce - which makes no sense bc you fry something so it will be crispy (ideally) - but then you dump it in a watery sauce so it becomes a mushy mess? And, it still had no flavor. Beware - the ""quesadillas"" are actually empanadas and they rest on a bed of very spicy sauce. It was the only item I enjoyed (all 2 bites worth), but it almost took my man down. He's delicate.The guac was just ok - lacking flavor punch, and served with the now infamous 3 fried tortillas. Luckily a nice busboy stopped and offered us a couple more so we could polish off our average guac.Someone in the kitchen must be on a low sodium diet bc everything seemed to lack salt - and they don't even have salt shakers on the tables. I didn't bother asking for one for fear of getting charged.The thing is, I would have paid the money and put up with the service if the food had been great - I would love to support a new local place trying to make it happen in the Mission. But this wasn't that.",na
"A solid 3.5Now if I was giving out my Yelp rating based solely on the pizza alone my rating would easily surpass the 4 mark. This pizza is magical folks ( and I don't mean magical tasting when consumed drunk). No, this is thin crust piled high with toppings and fixins eager to be consumed. I had passed by this place for years, occasionally ducking in for a slice or two to go before heading out to the location of my next bout of drunken shenanigans. The slices to go only clause never bothered me as I find pizza a highly transportable food. But one evening not too long ago I broke down and actually found myself dining inside. A friend of mine and I have been having some boy problems and were up for a pity party table for two. Seriously, a bitchery-pitchery session* can only be capped off with something hot and gooey. We went for a half veggie, half meaty large or extra large and a pitcher of beer for optimum comforting purposes. Yeah we'd take a slice of each and fold them over like some ridiculous over stuffed sandwich. Yeah holy yum yums, we stopped complaining and started shoveling in uber fresh toppings. The veggies were crisp, the meat was thick, flavorful and spicy and somehow the crust was not soggy to the point of flopping all over the place. My main pet peeve was the ambiance and decor. Honestly, the tables and chairs reminded me of a parish hall ready for a spaghetti dinner and yeah, it was distracting to look at the huge vacuum located right behind my friend's head. The waiter, though polite enough, seemed really indifferent to being a server. Really if my friend and I are going to drop close to $50 on pizza and beer for two is wrong to expect a wee bit more? I'd definitely return but I think I'll stick with the to go route. *bitchery-pitchery session: where two or more females get together to complain, whine and commiserate on what's been going on and going wrong over a few beers",na
"In San Francisco recently on business. After my first meal at Perbacco I returned every night because I had to try as many dishes as possible...its that good. Highlights were the pappardelle with rabbit ragu, roasted octopus (OMG), dark chocolate-basil bonet for dessert. The food is SUPERB, and if you're lucky to have a waitress as good as Amber, your meal is elevated to a truly wonderful experience. She REALLY knows her stuff, knows her wine pairings, made great recommendations and is an absolute delight!! A memorable meal with memorable service. Can't wait to return!!",na
"I'll start with the end first. When people, including me, speak about San Francisco being the best restaurant town in America, I use Seven Hills as the singular example of why that is true. It's a neighborhood restaurant, the food is pick-anything-on-the-menu and be blown-away good, the food and wines prices are extremely reasonable for the quality, and Alex at the front of the house could give Danny Meyers a lesson or two on how to treat customers right. It's truly perfect in my book. I've lived in SF for 13 years, and I've been coming to dinner here for many years prior. My wife is in the wine industry, and we are both foodies. Seven Hills to me is the quintessential SF restaurant. I've eaten there 40 times.. The Ravioli Uovo is the best dish in all of SF in my opinion. But I've never tried many items, and there was never one that I wasn't thrilled with.The food and wine menu are both perfect. The have the perfect balance of enough choices, but not too many so as to have any dish or wine be less than spectacular. And it the world of empire-building and corporate formula restaurant greed, it's refreshing to see prices that are so reasonable, and amazing given the quality. And last but not least, you cannot underestimate the impact of the front of the house person on a restaurant. Alex is fond of saying ""I don't like 'no', it's such a negative word"". He'll bend over backwards to accommodate a reservation request. He'll send you across the street to a wine bar when it's overflowing, and then come over and personally tell you your table is ready. And he makes every guest feel like a regular. Seven Hills. Best restaurant in San Francisco. It's my go-to can't-miss. I bring every single guest in town there. I never get tired of it, and my guests are always blown away.",na
"Not sure why there's so many low ratings but this place is the place to go when you want some good chinese food! Their beef fried rice, sweet and sour fish, and string beans with chicken are BOMB!! My dad is obsessed with ordering food from this place they know us now!! They have a coupon on their pamphlet menus for a free fried rice when you order over a certain amount! Also other coupons but that's the one my dad uses the most!! Fast and decent prices! Very nice workers as well(:",na
"We came here for a Bachelorette on 9/19, we had 10 people and when we called they said they don't take reservations...no problem we got here around 840 (the close at 10) and they couldn't seat us for half an hour, no problem the awesome host pointed us in the direction of a great dive bar and we has a blast waiting.We did not know, however, that they were going to be mad and complaining the whole time about us getting sat late (it was about 930 by the time we finally got sat). We were really turned off by the attitude. We didn't get our drinks until after we ordered dinner.We are all in the industry so we completely understand getting sat late, but the constant, in your face reminder, of ""well our kitchen closes at 10"" •_gets to be an insult especially when we got here before 9. By the time our food came out mine was so cold (I got Carne asada) I couldn't eat it and sent it back, asked them to warm it up, they said they don't have a microwave but they would ""see what they could do"" no apology or anything. Then we found out, after no last call, that the bar closed at the same time as the kitchen.We could see and hear the staff complaining and talking crap about our table, it was so off putting we almost walked out. The manager never once came over to say hi or apologize about our 2 mistaken plates (another girl never received her food and finally had it comped). All on all we all left with a little bit of a spur taste in our mouth, if it weren't for the food we wouldn't have stayed. Ps the girl with the sexy hot pink hair was the only one to not rush us, and go so far as to offer us desert and coffee, when out own server didn't do so. Thank you hot pink hair!",na
"I came here with high expectations but left feeling mediocre. I got the stuffed quail and it was really salty! I almost couldn't finish it. For the price tag, I feel like the food definitely could have been better. Dessert saved the day though, can't remember the name but it had pear in it! While the main course was too salty, the dessert had the perfect level of sweetness! Probably won't be coming here again.",na
"Inexpensive, good food! Try their new Shar Char Chicken Noodle Soup. It is heavenly.Hole in a wall place but you can't go wrong with the prices or the quality of food. I highly recommend it.",na
Very good food. The Dry Braised Chicken Wings (4 out of 5 as San Tung gets a 5 out of 5) are amazing and the Egg Roll is good too.,na
We just had the best little dinner on the last night of our trip to San Fransisco. This place was perfect. The owner is a little old(ish) Italian guy who greets you at the door. His charming wife came over to the table to talk to us. His daughters served us. We had great apps - wonderful dinners - everyone cleaned their plates. Looked like a great wine list if you want a bottle. We ordered by the glass and enjoyed our wine completely. We were giving hugs by the time we left because we felt like family. We'll definitely remember this night and be back next time we're i town.,na
"This place is so cool. It's my boyfriends fav or close second fav spot in the city. In the mission, close to Bart. Unassuming. Hole in the wall with Chinese New Year style dragon hanging all over the ceiling and deep red lights. We call in the inferno sometimes. Spicy food! Not everything is spicy but if you think it might be spicy, it's spicier than that. Soooo Good. Thrice cooked bacon, wings, pastrami, and salted cod fried rice are the only items you need. And sake and beer to cool the burn. You're welcome.",na
Yah this restaurant has it going on. The dim sum dishes were all really excellent and very fresh. Great flavor and the right amount of spice - but be careful spicy means spicy. i always ask for mild. The best thing us the flavor and the freshness. Yum - but also take care the place is often packed.,na
"We •_decided to eat here after attending the Uncorked Wine Festival. •_There were a lot of tourists around, but it was a beautiful day by the water and they have great outdoor seating.I ordered their mixed salad, and my husband had the shrimp and crab cocktail. •_Both were excellent.We had great service. •_I found the prices to be very reasonable.",na
"GET THE CALI BURRITO!! Thursday night + packed dinner hour. Place is small but i managed to get a seat when our food was ready.

"I came on a Saturday afternoon, and was seated immediately. Customer service was great, and very attentive to our requests. The food and drinks were good quality, but the menu's were very limited. Also a little pricey for the amount Ex: ordered a burger and fries, but there were only 4 French fries Definitely Recommend, but not the place for big esters or if you're expecting a good portionAlso, The $40 margarita isn't worth the price, small quantity (came in basically a beer mug with small glasses that were supposed to allow for 5 drinks) and average taste",na
"Little Star steps out from other San Francisco pizzerias to offer deep dish as well as thin crust. •_This isn't Chicago Deep Dish, though; it's California Deep Dish, ala Zachary's of Berkeley. •_Garlicky, cheesy and full of spinach and other good things. •_The white pie is also good.Little Star is probably second to places like 211, Ragazza and Delfina for pizza quality -- for one thing, their menu selection doesn't really vary seasonally at all -- but they're also more affordable, both in the pizzas and in the wine/beer menu. •_This is the pizza place you go to when you're too tired to cook, but don't want to spend a bunch.",na
"I hated everything about this place. •_There was no atmosphere and the fucking door was left wide open allowing the lovely frigid bay breeze to sweep its brusque arms around the restuarant, knocking over napkins, chips and the occasional todddler. •_I paid a full $8 for a taco the size of a wafer cracker and a glass of what was supposed to be sandia but was actually meth mixed with sugar and maybe a piece of watermelon. •_We were given 3 numbers for our food, when indeed we only had one order, but the cashier insisted we needed 3. •_When the server brought the food he asked us over and over why we had 3 and then rolled his eyes in that 'oh my god you stupid customers have 3 numbers' sort of way. •_Ya'll know that look.",na
"I've spent a lot of time in San Diego where Mexican restaurants are like McDonalds. Their cheap and everywhere. You can get a burrito for $5 and its stuffed with cheap greasy beef. Many of the Mexican restaurants in San Francisco are more true Mexican food. But Orale Orale sort of reminds of the good old fast food Mexican. Its a little more expensive (about $8) but its quick and easy. The meat they use is actually pretty good. Its juicy and flavorful. I got the carne asada supremo, which came with guac/sour cream which is essential to any burrito. The tortilla they use is a little flimsy and tends to fall apart as it gets soggy from soaking up the grease and juice. The service was great. Caters to a lot of lunch time office workers so it gets backed. Theres are separate lines for take out and seating. They workers are fast and friendly which was a big plus to this place. They seem to have only one type of salsa and some store bought tapatio as their hot sauce menu so that was a little disappointing. Other than that the food pretty fresh but it could be cheaper.",na

"This place was awesome. Had dinner here on Saturday night. Food was excellent (we shared a pozole and a mixed fajita plate). The chips and salsa were free and were kept topped up all night.The pitchers of margaritas went down even better, delicious!Friendly efficient service and a live mariachi band really completed the night. Reasonable prices too. We had to wait 25 mins for a table on a Saturday evening, so best to reserve if possible.",na
"I was visiting San Francisco back in March 2016 and my friend took me here. •_It was highly enjoyable due to the sleek and trendy atmosphere, as well as the drink and food selection. The portions were pretty small but besides that everything else was amazing. I ate here for dinner at around 5:00 PM and I was tremendously impressed with the hip-hop background music. Definitely an enjoyable place to go to and I look forward to going back next time I am in the Bay.",na
"Not a bad taco. I like that they have an intermediate ""special"" level between regular and super, that just adds cheese and guacamole, which is how I like my tacos. The grilled chicken quality is good. Spicy salsa could be spicier, though.",na
"This place is a must try! From the food made with pure love to the customer service, you will be taken care of and will leave happy, wishing you could eat there every day. If I had to recommend one thing and just one thing (there are so many) I'd recommend the gnocchi. Like little buttery Italian pillows, they melt in your mouth. I think I died and went to heaven - a happy, delicious, soft, pillowy heaven. I love that it's a family run business. And all of the staff I encountered spoke Italian. It's like I stepped into Little Italy and was apart of the family. I immediately felt welcomed and at home at the same time. I will be back tomorrow and will recommend this place to any friend in town. Buon cibo, buon vino, buoni amici.",na
"I realize OJ's doesn't need my recommendation. It's packed nightly. But my husband and I love to go into the bar area, sit on the plush green banquette by the fireplace, order something to drink and/or eat, and relax. It's so cozy and comfy and luxurious at the same time. The staff is professional and friendly. The food is pricey but excellent. The decor and soundtrack make me feel like I've gone back to the 70s, but in a good way, which may be why mostly older white people go here. It's not super hip. But we love this place.",na
Pizza - 8/10. You can taste the freshness in the ingredients. The sauce is unique and tastes spectacular.The crust is NY style..almost close to what you get with wood burning ovens. Delivery - 10/10 . It's just great when you get a pizza delivered piping hot just like it is in the restaurant. I would give it 5 stars but 30$(including tip) for a large Victor's special delivered is a little on the expensive side. They do not have any coupons or specials. But I guess when the quality and service is this good you can pay a little more.,na
"My family and I ordered a pizza from the Marina Patxi's in great anticipation of tasting their acclaimed offerings. After 2 hours of waiting for delivery to Russian Hill, we called to cancel. We were starving! The delivery guy showed up 10 minutes later while we were walking back from our neighborhood joint with pizza but didn't offer any excuse other than there must have been a ""misunderstanding"" of how long the delivery would take. Me thinks I'll forgo ordering from Marina Patxi's again.",na

As stated in other reviews - this is an old style Italian restaurant. •_You will not be getting olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip your bread in. It's just plain french bread and butter. The place is still the same as it was it was opened in 72. It's basic old school •_Italian and you're likely to find all the old familiar standards. My wife got ravioli in a pesto sauce. I ordered am Italian sausage sandwich. My wife liked her ravioli - it was good but not grate. I was disappointed by •_Italian sausage sandwich as it was cut into 2 one side had the sausage with sauce and no cheese - the other side had sausage and sauce but no cheese and the roll the sandwich was in •_- meh. The wait staff was nice but slow - they seemed more busy talking to each other than giving service. I'd say the pizza is the food to order here. The prices were reasonable - but on my part I would have given it another star if the cooks were more attentive to the food and wait staff would socialize on their time off. Do one to leave with one complement - their homemade italian dressing was very tasty and the high point. However next time I'm on Clement - think I'll stick to some of the awesome Asian restaurants there and if I want Italian go to other places in The City.,na
Stopped in here based on the positive reviews and I'm so glad I did. I sat in the bar watching the harbor and enjoyed the lobster bisque and a sole entree. And a phenomenal gin cocktail. My server was incredibly helpful and very friendly. This is a hidden gene in the very touristy Fisherman's Wharf area. •_All organic and locally sourced. And delicious too!,na
"We reached there are 4pm. They were still serving lunch items. I ordered ceviche ( too much lemon), fish burrito was the best,my husband ordered chicken tamales and he loved it. Overall the food was great. I loved their margarita. I wish they had less ice. I'll definitely recommend this place in city for Mexican food.",na
"Amazing. A hole in the wall with one table, but the dim sum is mouth watering.",na
"Everyone has their favorite taqueria, and this one is mine. What takes it over the top for me is not just their burritos -- which are spectacular -- but the rest of the menu. The tamales are great, the taco plate comes with guacamole and sour cream standard, they have tons of drinks to choose from, and their chips are freshly made in-house. And the salsa? Red and green; both are hot, and both are very flavorful. Nothing watery here. The only thing I find myself wanting are radishes and pickled carrots on the table, but that just gives me a reason to try something else and not come here every single time I want a burrito.",na
"Fusion sandwiches are amazing! The pork belly and spicy chicken are both really good and super popular.Try to avoid the lunchtime rush, because there is always a line out the door",na
"Was really looking forward to this place due to all of the mostly positive reviews.Their dim sum is on the larger side as far as portion sizes go.The Har Gow, Shui My, and Char Sui Bao were on the better side.The chicken feet, sticky rice in lotus leaf, potstickers, and shrimp and chive dumplings were on the bad to less than average.The main drawback was that all of the food was cold, some to the point where they were downright frozen. •_An Eskimo would have been very happy living inside of the potsticker given is frozen temperature, thick skin and large size. •_Probably better than most igloos out there, LOL.",na
"Wow, was totally surprised by this place.Decor is modern and clean and the food was delicious.Dim Sum sampler - delicious, great for 2 people, 8 pieces. •_ •_Sea bass - flakely and delicious.Jasmin tea smoked chicken - crispy chicken, just didn't like the sauce. •_It's one of their signature dishes.Tofu dish - I forgot which one but it was fried tofu in a light sauce.Great place for a company dinner or a date. •_Highly recommend.",na

"I think my mistake was stuffing myself with the guacamole dip and downing that with tecate. •_Speaking of the tecate, they serve it with a fancy glass cup which makes me think I'm drinking a really expensive beer even though it's the ordinary tecate.If you have room in your stomachs, there's more than a handful of entrees that are good. Chile releno, flauntas, empanadas, and the Churros are the items I loved and wouldn't mind eating again.*** Note: Beer goes well with the food so order 1 or more. •_I'm not a margarita person but my friends liked it so I'll trust their word and say order that too.",na

"I tend to think that places where waits are incredibly long (especially in touristy areas) are likely to be overrated. Also -- perhaps because I'm often a skeptic -- when places are built up so much by people I usually walk in with doubt from the start. Now, Mama's was pretty good. Was it worth the value and worth the wait? No. This is solidly a 3-star joint: not bad, not fantastic. It's alright. I went it on Tuesday afternoon around 1. My boyfriend and I stood in line for about 20-ish minutes which is apparently awesome given that Mama's is known for hours-long waits particularly on weekends. Once you're let inside, you pay for your food up front. There is a large menu of brunch/lunch items and beverages. Pay attention to the area near the register because there are specials and cocktails taped to the glass wall that aren't on the paper menus. While in line you'll see their various pound cakes, crumb cakes, and other goodies to entice you while you wait. The space itself is rather small which is another reason why the waits are long. It's a charming and cozy corner spot -- very old school San Francisco. Mama's is adorned with kitsch and newspaper clippings and photos from the distant past. In terms of service: rather efficient and friendly.We ordered the Monte Cristo. Oh, yes. It *is* delicious and probably one of the better Monte Cristos I've had. Portion-wise: it's a disappointingly small for the price tag ($12.95). The bread is beautifully eggy and rich and the homemade jam to dip the sandwich in is lovely. We also had the Pan Dore ($10.95): a sourdough baguette French toast that is also eggy and is lightly covered with a wonderfully not-too-sweet lemon butter sauce. I also had a basic iced tea with my meal. In all, from the point we stood in line to our first bite, we waited about 45 minutes which wasn't too bad. In the end, Mama's is worth trying once. It's a San Francisco institution. We decided that we probably won't go back any time soon since we walked away with a reaction of ""meh."" Long lines (again we went on a Tuesday afternoon which seems to be the way to go!) coupled with a higher price point for middle-of-the-road food... eh, we'll pass.",na

"This place gets 1 star because chipotle has better tacos for cheaper. There's no reason to go somewhere with such uninspired and bland food. Also, when I checked my credit card statement about a week after going to this place I noticed that I was overcharged by $30. This is either a careless mistake or an intentional overcharge to my account. Either way. I would never go to this place again.",na
"Hits:-The grilled octopus was life-changing!-You can't dine here and not try the giant Raviolo Uovo.-Pappardelle is one of my favorite pastas and lamb is my favorite type of meat. Needless to say, I loved the pappardelle dish with braised lamb ragu.Misses:-We and the couple next to us were accidentally served fried codfish balls instead of Arancini Fritti. The fish was extremely salty.-When we finally received the arancini, I felt like it was missing a sauce to tie the dish together. Without it, the deep-fried balls had a rough and dry mouthfeel.-Similar to the arancini, the quail was also lacking sauce. The seasoning was very bland. It was interesting to find one quail in a spread-eagle position and the other with a third leg...-While our server was nice, we weren't told of the arancini special (found out when the table next to us ordered it) and didn't receive a birthday candle with our dessert as we had requested.Conclusion:I wanted to love this restaurant really badly and tried some good dishes during my visit. Unfortunately, they weren't enough to outweigh the cons, which means Cotogna is still my favorite rustic Italian restaurant in the city.",na

I thought the pizza was much better here than the pizza I had in Italy.My friend ordered a dish. I don't remember what it was called but it was very small and the same price as my dish. She said it was really good, but a bit on the pricey end.I really did enjoy my food, but the service was lacking. I went when it first opened at noon time.

With its plush couches for relaxing and wildly colorful decor to bring about a fun ambiance, Azucar Lounge almost guarantees a great time.------------------FOOD: (From best to worst)Churro =- Weird how these churros were the hit of the night. Warm, crispy churros with a cinnamon cream dipping sauce -- we kept ordering these babies.Guacamole w/ Chips = - Delicious. I love the warm tortilla chips here and the guac was nicely seasoned without being too overpowering with any one ingredient.Carnitas Taco = - My first carnitas taco was delicious.

"A cozy but lively little place on Fillmore in lower Pac Heights that serves delicious Italian food. I sadly had to give it three stars because the both items that I had chosen to get were sold out that night. I suppose that's not really their fault at all, but I ended up being underwhelmed by the dish that I had.The chicken liver mousse was particularly good and the highlight of the night. The flavors were perfectly balanced with the fruit and the toast that was served with it was flavorful and delicious. I thought the other antipasti that we had (the pig ear with pork belly, potato, goat cheese, and garlic) was rather disappointing though. The goat cheese seemed to not complement the other flavors well and somewhat muffled the flavor of the rest of the dish. The meyer lemon fettuccine was particularly good though. The pasta was perfectly prepared with well balanced flavors to round out the whole dish.Overall the experience was okay, the service was good, but the food left something to be desired. I will definitely try it again one day since I feel like there is definitely great potential here.",na
Terrible food. Looks good. But taste not there. Service was lousy. Charge to the game,na
"I stopped in at the end of a long day trip in San Francisco. This food was DELICIOUS. I think this may be the best Italian food I've ever had in my life. I love how you can customize your dinner by choosing which pasta you want and pairing it with one of their amazing sauces. Everything is made right in front of you by some super cool, you guessed it, Italian guys. I highly recommend this quaint little joint and will definitely be returning next time I make it out to SF!",na
"I really enjoyed my meal at Quince before they closed for their relocation. We had late reservations at 9:00pm (okay, late for me!) but that did not deter us from an exquisite meal. •_The ambiance was warm, cozy and intimate with elegant, cream walls and beautiful chandeliers. I could actually have a decent conversation here. •_We ordered the tasting menu and instead of racking my brain for the exact dishes all I can say is....sigh. I liked every single dish and they did an excellent job with the execution and the pacing of the dishes. •_I was really impressed with the level of service that they had and was not disappointed at all.I would love to try Quince again when they open up at their new location which will be at Pacific and Montgomery.",na

"Good dim sum, reasonable price, this was always my second go to, but my first place is gone so this is it. Food was good, help is friendly. Parking is a bitch Worth a stop. I will definitely stop again when I'm in the city on Clement Street a lot easier than Chinatown !",na
"Great food, great service, reasonably priced. Very small place though, so I'd recommend visiting off peak hours.",na
"This place has the best and bombing burritos! I've been here several times and ordered the steak and chicken super burrito, veggie burrito, and quesadilla. The ladies taking your order are often very nice and attentive of what ingredients you want to opt out for your burritos. I often order the super burrito instead of a regular burrito just to get the most out of my money. I'm not too sure about the exact price but I think the super burrito was only a dollar more than a regular one with a few inches more of goodness. I would definitely recommend this place for burritos if you're starving because they have great portions at an affordable price, around $7.50+ for a super burrito that fills you for two meals, possibly three meals,what's there not to love?",na
"Pollo asado - •_among the best in town •_- their chicken chile verde items are also excellent.Solid al pastor and fish tacos - barbacoa wrap's pretty good too!Burrito's not so great, quesadillas could be better....I would agree that the ingredients that they claim are local and fresh are at least truly fresh-tasting!All the really really really hot sauce you want!You actually wanna sit down on a friday and catch up on Mexican futbol while sippin ur •_$2 corona (I would pass on the so-called margaritas.)Clean, quick, and feels like Mexico.....can't get enough!",na
"Azucar! I remember my pops screaming that out when he was excited or happy pretty much as far back as I can remember. Popularized by Cuban singer Celia Cruz •_the joyful exclamation translates to sugar, but it means so much more. •_Don't let my skin tone fool you - I am Cuban!Now, this place isn't a Cuban spot. It's actually Mexican. And they have a mean Taco Tuesday. All you can eat tacos for $10. With a deal like that it's easy to see why this place was SLAMMED on a Tuesday night. Are the tacos the best ever? No, not really. Are they decent? Yea! For the price is it worth it? Absolutely!We had a couple of bites including the mac",na
"Second time going to Tacko for lunch. Really wanted to love this place but the disappointment of today's food will probably keep me from coming back. Got the Mexican tacos and elote. All the meat was pretty average. Chicken was the best. That doesn't say much though because the carnitas and carne asada were dry and flavorless. I didn't eat the carne asada since I didn't see the point. I filled up on chips and salsa, which were the best part of the meal. Red and green salsa are tasty. I don't like to much spice so they are my kind of salsa. Elote was fine. Probably better to eat in the restaurant though. Kinda feels like I flushed $15 down the drain. The decor of the place is lovely. I wish the food was too.",na
"This restaurant was recommended as a place I couldn't miss while in San Francisco. I was exhausted from traveling all day and decided to order delivery to my hotel. I ordered an appetizer, chicken entree, and rice dish. The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time but I was missing my appetizer. I found it so disappointing. When I called about the missing food the person who took the call made it seem a little unreasonable to have the appetizer delivered at this point. The rice is good but •_a little bland and the chicken entree has good flavor but the portion size is not appropriate for the price. Overall the cost was not worth the food or ""service"". Maybe the dine-in experience would have been better.",na
The food here is incredible and very reasonably priced. The only draw back is the space is small and waiting for a table for lunch can take a while but thats what take-out was created for! Dont forget to try the chicken wings...AMAZING!!!,na
"This place is by far the best Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten at! We were in San Francisco for Labor Day week and we found Clay Pot via a search through Yelp. The reviews are spot on! So amazing and the price, you just can't beat it. My friend decided to order a highly reviewed item, the Honey Walnut Prawns....OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!! The best dish ever!!!!! My husband really wanted some salt and pepper squid, it wasn't on the lunch menu but our waiter said they'd make it anyway. The best salt and pepper squid in the world!!! Sadly I can't remember the other two dishes ordered because it's been a while, but I know they were good. Clearly the Honey Walnut Prawns and the Salt and Pepper squid were the stars. I highly highly highly recommend going here on your next visit to Chinatown in San Francisco! You will not be disappointed!","squid,prawn"

There is always a wait, but you can put your name on the list and walk around the cute stores on Chestnut Street. Now, they do allow you to call in and put your name on the list as long as you check-in within the hour which is definitely a nice plus to the dining experience overall. Food: We always order the same thing and I am never disappointed. We start with the Burrata Bruschetta with hazelnut",bruschetta
Love this place.Great carnitas tacos (not sure how widely known it is that they serve tacos -- most people seem to order burritos) if you're not hungry enough for a burrito.Been to all three Gordos; interesting to note that the flavor of the food differs somewhat by location. •_Irving,taco

"This week I fell in love with a duck. The diner next to me was served a platter of crispy pork and duck on a bed of rice with cabbage. When it came time for my order, I wiped my chin and pointed to my neighbor's dish that I was adoring with saucer eyes. It was love at first sight.When the meal was served, I quietly moaned at every bite of the flavorful fat, tender breast and crispy skin of the roasted bird. When the check arrived, I nearly fell over. Six bucks are you kidding?! The hostess introduced me to chicken feet and other delicacies on my way out. ""You try these next time. You'll like them."" She said. Walking away in a cloud of ecstasy, I agreed. I would have believed anything she told me.","pork,duck"

"I was wondering if it was truly the ""Thinnest Pizza"". It sure was! Read more below..Review by a vegetarian--Interiors are quite nice and airy. The wait staff is pretty good, although serious at times :)We started off with the Stefania's Salad. Never before has Cheese + Olive Oil + Walnuts + Apples tasted so good! We pretty much cleaned the plate. It is served with a nice little helping of bread, which is sufficient for the salad, but not enough to fill you up. This is good, as the best is reserved for the PIzzaWe ordered the Ricciola, which has thinly shaved Zucchini. When we got it, it truly was thinly shaved, and looked awesome. Pizza was extremely thin, nice helping of salt, good tomato sauce with cheese and zucchini. The ingredients might sound a bit weird together, but it was perfectly balanced, and extremely tasty!Check out the photo I've uploaded, to get an idea on how really thin the zucchini is. (Haven't done so yet)For Dessert, we were too full to try any of the true desserts, so we tried their Biscotti and cookies. These were pretty good too.

I never heard of this place until my friend's brother mentioned carne asada fries. I guess it's because I'm not usually in the mission unless it's for coffee and cookies. But I'm glad I found this place. Their carne asada fries is probably the best I've ever tasted in a while alongside with their mango salsa! The joint is not busy at 12 am but when 1am hits then the place gets packed with drunk people leaving the clubs. I will be returning here shortly!,"fries,coffee,cookie,salsa"

"LOL I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO WRITE A REVIEW ABOUT THIS PLACE.I'm so done.Here's my story: Back in December, I was getting dinner with a friend here. I got here before my friend did. They seated me in this awkward-ass nook like right behind the check-in counter/host stand or whatever when there is plenty of seating in the center of the restaurant. I'm like lmao ok, that's cool. It's just a seat. (I honestly was just like 'lol', because my friend couldn't find me after she came in, even after I was calling her name. The nook is *that* awkward.) I got the Crispy Egg Noodles with Chicken because a lot of the things on the menu were overpriced for me, but this is also San Francisco, so okay whatever it's fine. The food came. It was ok, nothing special. Chinese food re-styled for mainstream American tastes. Same old, same old. (I honestly enjoyed it still, I'm Panda Express Fan #1 lmao)But here's the kicker. I didn't finish my food. There was just a bit left; not enough for a whole meal, but idk, I paid money for this, so I wanted to take it home. And so the manager or whoever in charge comes over and gives my friend a box, because she had a significantly larger portion left than I did, and didn't give me one. At this point, it's okay I mean - fair assumption that I wouldn't want it.But I wanted it, so I ask for a box. And this lady hella gives me this hella judgmental look and seems super reluctant to give me a box but I insist I want one and she brings one over.And so I'm honestly like WHAT. Are ur boxes made of freaking Tang Dynasty gold? Idgaf if I had one freaking noodle left, I paid for this and if I wanna take it home, I don't deserve dirty looks from you of ANY SORT. Unless your boxes are made of Tang Dynasty gold, which ok. BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE JUST YOUR REGULAR FREAKING CHINESE TAKE OUT BOXES. Bye. Tired of people that judge others for wanting to eat everything they pay for. Tired of people that judge others for not wanting to let good food go to the dumpster over the cost of a freaking Chinese takeout box, or over the effort and labor needed to walk over and pick up a freaking LIGHT AS AIR empty box.Jesus.

"It's pretty tough to find decent, non-touristy food in Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf, so I always dread it when an out-of-town visitor makes the request to eat near either of these areas. I ended up coming to Scala's this past week with my girlfriend and her uncle and it wasn't bad at all. We ordered bruschetta to start and they happily complied to our request to put the duck prosciutto on the side. The bruschetta was pretty tasty, but the bread was a bit too thin for the amount of topping. My girlfriend ordered the ravioli with lemon cream sauce and I order the gnocchi. Again, both of them were pretty good, but nothing outstanding. The service was friendly and accommodating, but the food was just average.","bruschetta,prosciutto,ravioli,gnocchi,Again,service"

"We had my sister's birthday here last Sunday, April 24th at 5:30pm as my other sister wanted an early dinner.The experience from when I called to make a reservation about 1 week out, was awesome. Even though I called during dinner time, Silvio answered and he could not have been nicer. You could hear how busy it was in the background but I never felt rushed.When we arrived at the restaurant there were only a few people there - granted they open at 5pm and we were there at 5:30, so we had a little extra attention which was awesome. The whole family works there and the interaction among them is exhilarating and entertaining.We sat on the 1st floor (i did not realize there was a 2nd floor probably because we were focused on getting to our table with the balloons and gifts.There were 6 of us and we each ordered something different. Silvio was our waiter and he was so wonderful at talking through each one and even gave a little history about the dishes which the restaurant is known for.All I know is that i am glad we did not fill up on the bread (which was great) because the food was absolutely delicious. I had the Paccheri Ripieni which was incredible. The sauce was amazing.Someone else had the Mezzi Rigatoni alla Norcina - again, awesome.Others had the pork dish which they raved about.The dinners were excellent.For dessert we had a few different items and each one was wonderful from the Cannolos to the Tartufo al Cioccolato and then to top it off, they brought a dessert with a candle and sang happy birthday - the night was amazing - the staff - amazing and the whole experience was absolutely worth it.

The fish was soft and tender, but it could've used some more seasoning. There was a light tomato based broth that had an herby highlight from oregano.

"Two reviews in a day is little too much but here I go..To start our experience was phenomenal. •_My friend is from out of town and stayed at the Scarlet Huntington not far walk from the restaurant. •_He called to see if he can get a reservation last minute and was able to talk to Alex the owner. •_Alex was so sweet, he made it work. •_Needless to say, where service is concerned, it is definitely a 5. •_Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the her menu and knew exactly what all the items tasted like. •_Bravo to the training crew!Seven Hills is influenced primarily by Alex's Italian grand mother with a primary item of homemade pasta. •_We started off with couple of prosecos followed by a bottle of Nebbiolo. •_We decided to do family style and chose several items off the menu to share. •_Started of with a seared foie gras with grilled strawberries. •_Mmm. •_The foie gras was about 3 ounces and very beautifully seared sitting on a toasted bread. •_Only complain on this is the bread was slightly too thick. •_We then moved to a salad with fried prosciutto. •_Salad I would say is sub par. •_Color of the sugar snaps, radish, and prosciutto was so beautiful in itself, the heavy buttermilk base dressing was overwhelming and not attractive. •_We would've like it a little more light dressing to show case the beautiful color and the natural taste of the veggies. •_Our next dish was a grilled octopus tentacle. •_Nicely grilled and very tender. •_Nothing special but very tasty. •_The last dish we had was my favorite. •_It was ink squid pasta with shrimp. •_The pasta was perfectly al dente and shrimp was not over cooked. •_And we all know no matter how good the shrimp is, over cooking will kill it. •_We finished our dinner with a nice dessert wine.The ambience was ok. •_Casual vibe and casual. •_Slightly noisier than I anticipated but was ok. •_Parking, not sure because we use uber where you can. •_Lol.Overall, the food is good 4. •_Service was great at 5. •_Alex was around walking but did not make his way to all the tables. •_It would've been nice to chat briefly with him. •_Perhaps next time. •_Definitely worth your time and I can not wait to try other items on the menu.Until next time Bon appetite and ciao!","bread,prosciutto,salad,octopustentacle,pasta,shrimp,service"

"My girlfriend and I got pizza togo from here a couple of weeks ago and it wasn't as good as I was expecting.We ordered a medium pepperoni, and they told us about 15min. When we arrived there was a big line which is always a good sign, so we payed for our pizza and took it back home. By the time that we began eating the pizza the dough had become tough and chewy. The sauce and the toppings were delicious, but the crust was very unenjoyable.I think that if we would have sat down and eaten the pizza there it would have been a lot better, so I am going to give it a second chance but getting it togo wasn't the way to go.",pizza

"I was taking a nice stroll outside on a sunny Friday afternoon prior to Labor Day weekend when I noticed that there was barely a line at HRD, so of course I just had to try it though I wasn't planning on grabbing lunch! Every time I pass by HRD during a workday lunch hour, there is a fairly long line going out the door. It's quite a popular spot with its interesting Mexican Asian fusion dishes.I decided to try out their bulgogi beef kimchi burrito which caught my attention due to kiwi being one of its ingredients. The kiwi surprisingly went very well with the burrito. It added some sweetness to it whereas the daikon and kimchi gave it a sour taste. The result was a wonderful sweet and sour flavor that blended well with the marinated beef. After a while, I did feel that the burrito started falling into the diminishing returns factor, but I did enjoy it overall.",burrito

The bathroom was a hot mess, but with the volume and crazy people coming in on a Saturday night, it's par for the course.","place,burrito"
"Excellent gem that is extremely easy to miss, but a great place to get some quick eats after happy hour. Mabo tofu noodles, diced chicken, and the WINGS were definitely highlights. Our server was extremely nice and attentive, even though we came in right before last call, and she even made an accurate assessment that we'd be needing more food when we each ordered four dishes for four hungry guys. Once we had our orders in, she was quick to keep us topped off with water and tea.The food itself was delicious, with well-balanced flavors and an excellent variety of tastes and textures. I am coming back here soon for the diced chicken and wings though - small wonder that they were the absolute favorites in our group.","noodles,chicken,wings,service"

"Seven Hills is a quality neighborhood trattoria that remains popular and continues to deliver even after a change in ownership several years ago. While nothing about this intimate venue is ostentatious, that's because it's all about substance as opposed to style, whether in the cozy, rustic interior that lends itself to intimate meals, or in the relatively understated cooking that intentionally highlights the quality and freshness of the underlying ingredients. Indeed, quality and freshness pops up throughout the menu. For example, this restaurant is one of only about a dozen in the Bay Area that serves delicious, super-fresh buffalo mozzarella from Ramini Farms in Tomales, a small, family-run operation that's worth visiting on its own. The tomato braised polpette (fontina-stuffed beef and pork meatballs) was satisfyingly delicious, and helped prime the appetite for equally satisfying entrees like the pappardelle, maccheroncelli, and the day's fresh fish catch. Of course, I had to go for the chocolate budino to finish things off, and it didn't disappoint.Service is warm and engaging, and Alex, the manager, was also super patient and obliging with multiple changes of plans that I had. While Seven Hills might not draw a whole lot of buzz in the Bay Area dining scene, the throngs of loyal customers that pack this place on most nights testify to the fact that an intimate, personalized, no-nonsense dining experience can be just as satisfying as, say, a dozen-course molecular tasting menu at some place that's ridiculously ostentatious. Totally worth the 5 stars here on Yelp.","mozzarella,polpette,pappardelle,fish"
"I have been a fan since the opening of cotogna and often have brought friends and family to eat here over the years, but I am sad to say the food has really gone downhill....really tasteless watery pasta, overdone pizzas, and fishy octopus (used to be my favorite dish here)....It is no longer worth my time and money. •_I went back 3 times just to make sure and it was confirmed....no longer good : (","pasta,pizza,octopus"
"*Note: This place is cash only.*This is a great hole in the wall spot that is worth going out of your way to try. As many others have said, the Tea Leaf Salad is incredible. Fermented tea leaves, cabbage, fried beans, nuts and other ingredients give an incredible flavor for this $6 dish you could easily pay 2-3 times for in a fine dining establishment and be happy with. The garlic noodles were great and every other dish I saw looked amazing as well. I don't think anything is more than $6. What a deal!Please note you're coming here for the food, not the ambiance or the service (although both should meet the functional needs for most). Personally I'm all about the food and value so if you share those focuses, this place is for you.","Salad,noodles,service"

Everything was so tasty, the combination fried rice, the Kung Pao chicken , pot stickers and the brisket clay pot. What made the Kung Pao chicken so great was it was 90% chicken and not a bunch a veggies with a few minuscule pieces of chicken, this was LOADED with meat, in fact the portions for everything were huge and right up my alley. Great friendly service and people. This was a great find ! I cant speak for their delivery service but eating inside their place, the food was fresh hot and my stomach was singing happy songs !! Highly recommended !","riedrice,chicken,service"

"Great looking place. Amazing atmosphere, amazing food.HOWEVER, horrible attitude from a man name Eldon.A couple friends and I had the back room prepped for us. It was our friend's birthday and it wasn't his first time; he assured to us that the food at nopalito was amazing since it was everyone else's first time... and he was right, the food was great! However, we also all agreed that the server was just rude RIGHT off the bat. Eldon did not ask how we were doing as he approached us. He also sounded just plain ANNOYED when he asked us if we were having drinks, although we were a bit indecisive, it does not mean to RUSH us. We all just chose water instead of us ordering drinks right there and then. When we asked Eldon about the types of food, or if Nopalito has empanadas, or how the food ordering works at Nopalito (because obviously it was our first time) he responded a sharp ""uh yeah, it's right there ON the menu"", Repeatedly ""yeah, it's ON the menu"", as if we're not looking at the menu, we're just curious! He also cut my friend off while he was asking a question about substituting meat, but the server cut him off saying ""NO, you can't do custom foods, not going to happen.""He also made a disturbing comment towards the end of the night. It started with him stating how we should download venmo in order to make our lives easier upon splitting the check. Our table let him know a fact about venmo, saying that it usually takes three days to process (because really, we just want to pay right there to make everyone's life easier). He answered ""you guys can't wait three days?"", and our response, ""no we can't, we just want to pay it now"". Then he had the NERVE TO SAY TO US, ""sounds like you guys need another job"". Excuse me? Just because we rather not use a phone app? We all received our degrees, we work 9-5 jobs, Monday to Friday, working hard, and just want to have a good time celebrating our friend's birthday ON A SATURDAY NIGHT. But we felt so uncomfortable when the waiter had the nerve to tell us we need another job just because we're figuring out payment. Plain rude. You don't know what our occupation is, so who are you to comment about our jobs?Hence why I'm providing four stars. Just for his specific service. Good place, but don't want to see the server's face. We wished the ladies came around more- just smiling at us and asking if everything was okay. But Eldon REALLY pissed us off last night. Yeah, we're young, want to have fun- but does not mean that you can talk down to us. Oh, and he didn't tell us his name- it's on our receipt.Don't think we'll come back. Good place. But don't think we will.","atmosphere,food"

"I had the Mexican food shakes the other week. What are the Mexican food shakes? Well, similar to a drug addict detoxing, when I don't get enough Mexican food in my system, I start to feel off, weak, and out of sorts. Usually this need can be satisfied by basic taqueria food, but every once in a while, my body cries out for something more substantial -- namely a sit down Mexican restaurant. Now I'll admit it... I'm a Mexican food snob and I have not been very impressed by the sit down offerings available to me in San Francisco. So when everyone raved about Tommy's I got my hopes up. Unfortunately, this place did not live up to the hype.Okay, to first focus on the good. The margaritas are good. Strong, not sweet, and delicious. I also enjoyed my chips and salsa. The not so good -- the food was just okay, not bad or anything, but nothing unusual for a sit down place in San Francisco. Also, our service was pretty bad on our first visit. It took them 15 minutes to bring us menus, and another 15 to take our order. •_30 minutes of just sitting there without chips, water, or drinks was a little frustrating (and it wasn't even that busy... the place was maybe 1/3 full). Since then, service has been about average -- not all that attentive, but not nearly as bad.Basically, this is a decent enough place to go when I get the Mexican food shakes, but it definitely makes me miss the food down in Southern California.","cocktail,food"

"Came in today craving a baked pasta dish. Ordered the baked tortellini with mozzarella and parm. Super happy with the bread for the table but the side salad was mediocre. The kidney beans, olives and garbanzos tasted old.. Like their can had been opened last week and not well refrigerated. Meanwhile, I made the mistake of not asking if the tortellini was vegetarian. I assumed that since every other dish in the Al Forno section distinguished between vegetarian and meat..and this didn't say meat, that I was safe. Anyways, tortellini came and I ate a few, thought the filling was a little strange but wrote it off as a bread crumb and cheese filler like some cheaper brands of tortellini. Then I noticed the TEENY chunks of ground beef in the sauce. When I brought this to the servers attention she acted like I should have known it had meat. I pointed out that the menu didn't specify meat sauce (unlike every other item) and she dismissed it.Now I'm super sick. Won't go back anytime soon :(","pasta,tortellini"

"Great experience here. I sat at the bar, got great food recommendations from the bartenders and enjoyed a great glass of wine. The meal pacing was really great and the food very solid. I started with the warm house-made ricotta (a dish certainly designed for sharing that I no doubt demolished on my own) and had a fresh pasta dish for my main. I was worried the ricotta + pasta would be a heavy combo, but the pasta was delectably light and fresh. If there was a low-light of the meal, it was dessert (chocolate mousse) - which was still good, just not knock-your-socks-off. A great option worth the investment. Good atmosphere. Nice vibe. Very approachable. Solid food. Definitely worth a visit.","wine,pasta,ricotta,dessert,atmosphere"
"Believe me when I say that this place is a legit hole in the wall. There's only approximately 10 seats at the counter, so you might have to wait at times. In spite of the cramped space though, Yamo seriously knows how to produce some delicious food. The women who work here know how to run this place efficiently, cost-effectively, and most importantly, deliciously. The food here is nice and incredibly flavorful (and oily). The tea leaf salad is a great starter. Although it's a little on the small side, it has great flavor and it's different from your typical tea leaf salad. My two favorite entrees are the Yamo House Noodles and the Mango Chicken. The noodles are very greasy and filled with tons of flavor and a light sauce. The meat is also always tender and cooked very well. The mango chicken also has tons of flavor, as there is nothing better than mixing the rice with the sauce and chicken. The chunks of fresh mango within the dish are generous and add a nice sweetness to the dish.Yes, you may not be getting the best service nor the cleanest services, but it all adds to the unique hole-in-the-wall-type vibe. It always amazes me to see how fast they are able to cook despite the lack of space and dim lighting. Even more, all the dishes here are no more than $6! (I think they actually recently bumped it up to $6.25....but still, it's a bargain!) What more could you ask for?! Don't be intimidated by its exterior (or interior for that matter...) appearance - this place serves great food at a great price!","noodles,chicken,price"
"The quality of the food is inconsistent. 4 stars when it is good though. But overall too inconsistent. The dishes I like from here are the Mapo Tofu, Chongqing Chicken Wings, and the Salt Cod Fried Rice. I almost never crave Chinese food but when I do, surprisingly it's this even though it's not ""authentic"" Chinese food. But over the past few years of eating here (mainly ordering for delivery), it's always a hit or miss. Sometimes it's delicious and spicy in a good numbing kinda way, and sometimes it's just bland. I ordered delivery last night and was disappointed. The chicken wings were way smaller than before, and it didn't have the crunchy tripe pieces. The tofu was spicy but bland. Very disappointing.","tofu,chickenwings,friedrice"

Both our dishes looked so bright and fresh! He also got a huge cup of coffee that had free refills. I wasn't a fan of the cherry tomatoes inside the omelette. They exploded everywhere as I tried to cut into the omelette. The potatoes were amazing and I usually hate potatoes. I ate almost all the omelette without even realizing it! Haha. The toast that came with it was so strange tasting. Really chewy and bland. Their butter was also unsalted so I just salted it myself. Nothing worse than unsalted butter!

"The food was great - I got the avocado taco, fish taco, and shishito peppers. They were all delicious! The bar staff was entertaining to watch and fairly attentive. My one complaint is that I found the hostess to be a bit unpleasant. I was a solo diner and wanted to use the restroom while I waited for a spot at the bar to open up (which was first come first serve and very very busy - I ended up waiting for an hour), but the hostess refused to keep an eye out for a seat for the 3 minutes it would've taken me to use the restroom cause she was too busy hostessing. I get that it's first come first serve... but it's a bit frustrating to think my hour long wait for a seat at the bar could've been extended to two hours if a seat opened up while I was in the restroom. If she had time to schmooze with customers throughout the restaurant for 2-3 minutes each (which she did a lot), she could've made the effort to help me not miss my chance at a seat. The first come first serve seating at the bar is also a poor system generally. It's sort of a matter of luck if you're standing close enough to the spots at the bar that open up. And some people sat at the bar for hours without eating... which would be fine if there weren't people who were waiting to sit. Just treat it as walk in seating for dinner, keep a waitlist, and separate people who want to just drink into an area that isn't possible seating for diners.",taco

They don't wear no steenking badges here, senor!But if you've ever been to Oaxaca, you know there is a whole other side of Mexico that has nothing to do with sombreros, mariachi bands and those plastic dogs that have the heads that go up and down on your dashboard when you go low riding in the barrios. In fact, Regalito is exactly the type of clean, modern-looking place you'd find along a side street in Mexico's culinary capital.Make no mistake that in a neighborhood full of great south-of-the-border eateries, this one stands out for the fresh ingredients they use in some interesting variations on basic Mexican dishes. Standing out in its own building on 18th Street between Valencia and Lexington, the small, tidy place inside has a warm vibe with a bright chartreuse hue on the walls and stainless steel and beech wood on the lengthy counter.I ordered the $12.50 Pollo Con Mole Negro, which is a quarter-chicken, free-range of course, covered in a thick Oaxacan mole full of chiles, nuts, and spices. It came with stewed pinto beans and rice. Tasty and the breast-dominated chicken was cooked to the right tenderness. My friend had the simpler $9.50 Pollo Regalito, which is the leg and thigh of a chicken marinaded in garlic, lime and chiles. It also came with the beans and rice.Barely three months old, they also offer pork, steak and veggie dishes which I look forward to trying some other time. There are also a bevy of appetizers and side dishes of which we just ordered the $3 Salsa Fresca y Tostadas, a bowl of incredibly fresh tomato, onion and chile salsa with deep-dried tortilla rounds you need to break apart to scoop up the salsa. •_Yummy and just enough of a teaser for the entree.They even offer a $9.95 ""Mexican worker's lunch"" consisting of agua fresca, a chosen entree (today it was a pork dish), dessert or coffee. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me. The staff is friendly and incredibly quiet though not in a dysfunctional way since I am making the grand presumption that it is a family-run place.Keep in mind that it is small (just three tables and the counter), so I imagine weekend waits are a given. Even though you can have dessert here, just walk up 18th two blocks to get your scoop of salted caramel at the Bi-Rite Creamery.FOOD - 4 stars...fresh tasting...you feel you've made the healthier choice in the MissionAMBIANCE - 4 stars...clean, contemporary and no sombreros, serapes or velvet paintings of orphans on burrosSERVICE - 4 stars...very accommodating but no worries, they don't hoverTOTAL - 4 stars...has potential to earn another star if they get more daring on the dishes but fine and dandy for what it is","chicken,beans,rice"
"Cheap, mass produced dim sum that hits the spot for those looking for a quick meal. Great for take out.Ordered:Shrimp Har Gow - Texture is a bit jelly feeling due to being oversteamed, should be more fim. Shrimp taste is okay.Pork shiu mai - Large pieces, acceptable, reminds me of 99 ranch dim sum to go.steamed a bit too longBeef shiu mai - Also large pieces, got some of that beef flavor in it, bit oversteamed probably due to sitting around longer, not being as popular as the pork version.While I wouldn't be really looking for quality dim sum in a ""to go"" place, if you're nearby and want something fulfilling","shrimp,pork"
"Cute little Italian restaurant in SOMA. The menu isn't incredibly extensive, but just enough variety for you to choose from. The space feels intimate; dimly lit with candles and soft overhead lighting. I especially like the brick and arches that make up the space. They also have photos and paintings on the walls that can be purchased from local artists. The service here is also top notch. Expect the waiters to be extremely friendly and doting.Now, onto the food. I always like to start with the burratta which they serve with prosciutto, arugula, and this balsamic sauce. My favorite dishes are the lamb ragu, the frutti de mare, and their lobster ravioli. Their saffron risotto leaves something to be desired. Entrees are approximately $17 each. Dinner for four will probably run you $30 a person including wine and appetizer to share.","service,price,ragu,ravioli"

"People who gave Emmy's a 4 or 5 star rating have not had good Chinese food. I don't get it. I've never dined in, but as a new Excelsior resident, I've been trying to find good Chinese delivery (Bamboo on Polk used to be my go-to for Chinese, but that was back when I lived in the Mission). I've ordered a couple of times and didn't really think too highly of it, but by the third time, I decided it was enough. They do the bare minimum with their vegetable dishes, and the two I ordered were Garlic Sauteed Spinach and Garlic Sauteed Broccoli. They both were VERY watery and lacking any flavor beyond garlic. There were literally big chunks of it with the wateriness of the steamed (or satuteed or whatever) vegetables, and that was it. No more! No sauce, no char, no nothing spectacular or noteworthy. BARE MINIMUM. And did I mention the wateriness???Side note: The sauteed spinach was so slimy and watery that I found it difficult to eat. So... I didn't eat it! But I did use it in spinach alfredo over fusilli the next day. If I had to re-purpose food from Emmy's, then that's saying something!!The other vegetable dish I ordered was alright. Three stars maybe. It was the Spicy String Beans (or something like that), and again, this dish lacked any flavor beyond spice. And yeah, I know that's what the name entails, but if I have to throw it into a pan and add more chili flakes, sesame oil, garlic, and soy sauce in order for me to want to eat it and get my money's worth, then what was the point of even ordering delivery in the first place??I also tried their Singapore Rice Noodles. Soooo good... USUALLY. The Singapore Rice Noodles at Emmy's were alright actually. Not bad even! Just that they didn't mix the curry very well so some bites were way more saltier than others, but again, not bad at all really.Lastly, the epic fail: Chow Fun. I got it with the sauce on the side. It was really bland and flavorless. A real let down to be honest. I'm from Hawaii and maybe the Chow Fun is different? (Yes, I think it is drier and saltier and mixed with char siu). But since moving to SF, I have found it difficult to find really good tasting chow fun. So who knows, maybe I have high standards and the chow fun at Emmy's isn't all that bad. BUT, let me just say for the record... I didn't eat more than four bites of it. I tried to like it, but.... No. Doesn't work that way. Into the trash it went, and for that, I got angry at myself for wasting yet more money ordering lackluster crap from Emmy's!!!Well I hope that's helpful. I am a vegetarian, so maybe their meat dishes are their best sellers? Basically their dishes are very bland and bare minimum-esque... That's my main critique.","vegetable,spinach,broccoli"

"San Diego, my girlfriend tells me, is unlike anywhere else when it comes to Mexican food. While visitors from all over the U.S. are a little shocked at the size of ""California burritos"" - burritos with sour cream, guac, and, good heavens, RICE - I was agape the first time I saw carne asada fries at Taqueria Los Coyotes, and the similar burrito.I'm not going to act the fool by comparing this to other taquerias because you really can't. Not on the basis of the carne asada fries burrito, anyway, since that's pretty uncommon for Northern California. •_I will say this, though: the concept is genius. Here you have a taqueria at the end of a street filled with bars, that's open late, cheap, serves comfort food and is the last thing between you and BART/MUNI/where the cabs pick up. Of course it's going to make money! The burrito was pretty ok, but after a night of drinking and dancing it was just what I needed. Not all comfort food has a positive additive effect when combined - pickles and ice cream only works if you're really high or really pregnant - but I can safely say that fries and burritos hit the spot. Would I go here for lunch, given the selection nearby? No, probably not. But Taqueria Los Coyotes has a niche and fills it quite well.","burritos,pickles,icecream"

"I was having dinner with girlfriends in the Marina and Delarosa popped up on Yelp as a great option. I saw on the website that the team behind Delarosa has connections to Beretta (amongst other restaurants) - I love Beretta and was excited to try Delarosa. Delarosa was great and I would definitely go back. The bar is a great spot to post up while you're waiting for friends or to dine with another friend. We were there on a Monday night and we were able to get a table quickly at 7:30. The big windows give it an open and airy feeling, and there are a few tables outside for those rare warm SF evenings. Most of the tables inside are communal and by the time we finished dinner (around 9:30), the music had been turned up to levels that made it tough to converse. The following is how I would rank the dishes we ordered: - Crispy taglioni dumplings: imagine a cheese and prosciutto-filled dumpling deep-fried and sitting in marinara sauce. So good, so gooey.- Mushroom pizza: great pizza dough - I normally don't eat crust but this was an exception. - Crab arancini: yes, more deep-fried food and this was also cheesy and delicious but maybe not the best I've ever had- Panzanella salad: great flavored with the fennel croutons but the tomatoes were a bit too soft / over-ripe and didn't hold up well in the salad","dumplings,pizza,arancini"

It is a typical foodie place. The dishes are well-prepared and presented. Servers are very attentive. We had both golden caviar and white truffle options. The truffle was in season and smelt exceptional. The dishes were small but we were full when we left. They gave us a warm chocolate on the way out which was a nice touch with the cold weather. Nothing against Quince. It seems that Michelin star restaurants treat food more like an art form than food itself. Something is lost here.,"truffle,caviar"
"I love the food here but the service can be hit or miss at times and not dependent on the rush (or lack thereof). They are very generous with the chips and salsa and have a great imported beer selection. I highly recommend the mole poblano and the fajitas. Margaritas are decent. The dê©cor is really fun and reminiscent of a restaurant in Guadalajara I visited. When the wait is long, you can go next door and have a drink while waiting and they'll come get you. Great neighborhood spot.","poblano,fajitas"
"This place was outstanding! As out-of-towners, my husband and I decided to risk it and try to sneak in a table at Tony's on a Saturday night. When we arrived, our hostess told us it would be a two and a half hour wait, but the bar area is first come, first serve. Tip: Wait by the bar! Something WILL come open! A wonderful older couple saw us patiently waiting and gave us their seats within 30 minutes of us getting to the restaurant. (I saw everyone that waited for a seat get a seat by the end of our visit.) The couple next to us got the New Yorker pizza, which looked and smelled like the most heavenly pizza known to man. We ordered a glass of IPA, a glass of Cab wine, three meatballs, and the New Yorker- all so delicious. The New Yorker has the best sausage/pepperoni combination I've had. Its huge- my husband and I couldn't finish it together. I would highly recommend it! Our bar service was outstanding and helped to make the experience great. We will be back to Tony's when we return to San Francisco.","pizza,wine,meatball"

"Looking for something outside of the usual pho establishments in the Tenderloin? Look no further - Hai Ky Noodle shop is right around the corner specializing in teochew noodles. This noodle shop has been around since 1987 serving Chinese styled broths. But we're all here for one reason and that is the braised duck noodle soup. I can't imagine how many ducks these chefs are braising out in the back, but practically everyone in the restaurant has made an order of this delicious soup. The noodles are SO very flavorful and the duck is not fat and the meat falls right off the skin unlike in most Thai or Chinese noodle soups. •_Note that I would definitely recomnend the thick egg noodle!

"Nice spot for some drinks and dinner.. definitely make a reservation in advance! It is a bit on the pricier side but some of the dishes were just really outstanding! I can't remember which cocktails I ordered, a peach something, but really tasty but not stiff.Crispy Duck Salad - holy moly, who would've thought a salad could be so good? This is a definite must if you're dining here. Super light, super flavorful. The duck wasn't too gamey, all the ingredients complemented each other well.Dim Sum Platter - good. I know it's just dim sum but you can tell that the quality and size of each item was better than your average dimsum from a cart. Truffle Braised Noodles with Crab and Scallops - I don't even care that much for truffle but holy moly, these noodles were tasty! The truffle went surprisingly well with the noodles. The scallops were cooked perfectly. I definitely recommend this!Stir Fried Black Pepper Beef - super tender and super delicious.Spicy Prawns - huge! It was so good but by the end of the meal I was getting really full and couldn't eat more than one prawn. The curry was really delicious though, and the prawn was very fresh. I loved this dish as wellDessert - I'm not too sure, I completely forgot what it was called but I know it was something with Kombucha.. but really good.

"Place is well known for crab. It feels like every time my mother in law is town she's always asking for that Vietnamese crab in the tenderloin. The crab is definitely 4.5 stars. Tasty and baked with fried garlic and jalapeê±os. I can't really tell if it's baked or fried. It tastes a little more fried and is pretty biteable with your teeth ( not that I'm recommending that- they totally supply utensils to crack the crab). The outside flavor is great but it feels a little bit like the crab meat inside is a little extra stringy through this cooking process. We got a hot and sour soup (Vietnamese style with chicken) - definitely 5 stars. It's very different from the more regular hot and sour soup at chinese/ asian places. It was more of a clear sour broth with chicken and vegetables. It's definitely my favorite dish I've had at the restaurant. As for the pea shoots, pan fried crispy noodles, and black bean filet dishes we also got - they were completely average, and a little on the bland side. I kept adding the crab's garlic and jalapeê±os to those dishes. Overall - come for the crab (when it's more in season otherwise it's $$$$), and surprise fantastic dish is the Vietnamese hot and sour soup.","soup,noodles,bean"
"Bar was PACKED on Cinco De Mayo. The food looked like it was a good portion. I didn't sit down to eat because there were no seats available, so to the bar it was!Margaritas were $7, but you can also buy a pitcher, which serves 4-5 people for ~$26. It was more than enough to give 6 of us drinks. Perfecto! I was planning to bar hop anyway, so we got a couple of drinks of margaritas and bounced.The floors were sticky when we went there, probably because people had been drinking the entire time. The only drawback I would have is that there was no announcement as to how to get a table to eat. I came with a group of 8ish people, and we didn't know we had to find the man sitting in the corner to put our name on the list. At least announce it, put it on the door, or have someone standing there directing people!

Add $2 for some meat on those and I'm in heaven. Their carnitas are flavorful and tender. Free chips and salsa as always. I enjoy that they have 3 different salsas on one plate. All taste great and love the spicy habanero one! Prices are fair which makes me happy considering San Fran prices can be expensive. Staff here are always nice but wait times and service can tend to be slow around HH and dinner rushes no matter what day it is. If you're coming to have a conversation, certainly don't sit in the bar. It is super noisy and the bartenders have a hard time hearing your order.

Peter (the owner) saddled up to our table to wait on us. Upon hearing that we are fans of Nan King, he smiled and quickly grabbed the menus from us.

We sampled some fabu dishes including a duck bun, crispy shrimp with apple, mushroom fried rice and a sauteed fish and greens. Don't ask me what the names were as most of the items weren't on the menu and rang up as misc items. All i can say is if you are in the area DEFINITELY head to Fang or House of Nan King.

"PROS: quality food, tasty soup base, many options for dipping sauce, attentive service, good value CONS: very long wait without reservation, condensation on low ceiling from hotpot that drips down on you (ewwww).

Turned out that they ""never"" had it, as told by a server.I ordered Nick's Way. At first, I was overwhelmed with my food because it was huge. I had to crunch it up to be able to eat it and it tasted mediocre.Not only was their food mediocre, but their servers weren't that attentive. Waited 10 minutes for one just to get a refill and another to get our check.Would not go back to this place.","margarita,service,food"
"This place is overrated and overly priced. I'm not sure why it became a michelin starred restaurant. The food is so salty, lost the original taste of the food, especially when you say you are a Chinese restaurant. If you claim that you are a typical American Chinese restaurant, that might be acceptable. Then in their wine selection, they did not include any Chinese wines. Not a choice at all. BUT they have Japanese wines? What are you a Chinese or a Japanese restaurant excuse me? Oh then it comes to the service. I'm not sure about the server's condition that day, maybe she just broke up with her boyfriend. The attitude was so bad that she almost hit the table with the water bottle. And if you would like explain to me that the display of the food is great, I would totally disagree with you. The food display is as standard as the fine dining in any western styled restaurant at the most, and not even close to any fine dining Chinese restaurant. I highly recommend the critics of Michelin to revisit their SF location and reconsider their ratings. What a disappointment. If I could, I would like to seek for a refund from their restaurant.","price,food"

My father took me here when I was a kid and always loved the place.I used to recommend this place as the best burrito in town but sadly report that this was one of the worst burrito I have eaten. My partner and I took a bite of our burritos and it was really bland and I had to drench it with sauce. The meat was cold and no flavor. Que Paso raza I am really disappointed and feel cheated. They seem they forgot to cook. Some many choices in San Francisco sorry me no come again!,burrito

"Enjoyed my birthday dinner here when my boyfriend treated me out.We asked for complimentary bread because we read about it on Yelp, but they don't seem to give it to you unless you ask. Make sure you ask if you want it! The bread was soft, and I loved the sun-dried tomato dipping oil. Just wished that the bread was warm because it was cold when we got it :( Still good, but could've been great if they warmed up the bread.I love bone marrow, so we ordered that as an appetizer. The bone marrow by itself was on the salty side a little more so than the usual, but eaten with the bread and parsley salad, it was great. Super rich and buttery like good bone marrow shouldbe.At this point, our server randomly gave us two pieces of bruschetta on the house. Nothing spectacular, but hey it was free! An unexpected small treat.For entrees, we ordered the smoked salmon tagliolini with black caviar (Tagliolini Salmone) and the squid ink spaghetti with seafood (Frutti Mar). I LOVED the squid ink spaghetti. Great amount of seafood, PERFECTLY cooked al dente pasta, and the tomato sauce was so good that I started eating it by the spoonful by itself towards the end. The smoked salmon pasta was more subtle. The pasta sauce was a little bland by itself, unless you got a bite with the smoked salmon or caviar. It was good, but I ended up wishing that there was more smoked salmon (even though they didn't necessarily skimp), just to make every bite as good as the ones with the salmon.We ordered the panna cotta for dessert, as per Yelper recommendation. They put a little candle in it for my birthday and also gave us two mini glasses of dessert wine to go with it--Another unexpected treat on the house. The panna cotta was creamy yet light, and it went well with the tartness of the berries. Didn't think it was as amazing as others made it to be, but still good.Overall, the stars of our meal were the bone marrow and squid ink spaghetti with seafood, plus the great service with unexpected items on the house. Well-deserving of 4 stars.","bread,cavia,spaghetti,pasta"

My boyfriend and I both had a spicy margarita - mine with mezcal (Mohave) and his with just tequila (la flama verde). Both were delicious! We also had the queso dip with chorizo to start. For our main corse we had puffy tacos, one crispy carnitas and one bbq beef brisket. I preferred the carnitas! We also had fish tacos which were pretty good. I love the vibe of this restaurant and I will definitely come back!","cocktail,queso,taco,beef"

"Not the best. Takes for EVER to get your order and they frequently mess up simple requests. Nice and clean and close to home. GF likes the chorizo burrito so I keep coming here but definitely not better than Street Taco on Haight (or even Lil Chihuahua if you don't want to leave the Divis corridor) or most taquerias in the Mission for that matter. Again, excellent Mexican food North of Geary seems hard to come by these days but maybe I'm just picky. They seem busy enough and won't go out of business anytime soon. Register clerk is super sweet, usually, but some staff are not as welcoming. Maybe they're stressed, who knows, but I really don't want to deal with 'tude when I'm hungry and waiting. Place is nice after remodel and has two flat screen TV's playing sports, but I gotta say, if they were three blocks further from my house I'd say f@k it.

"Let me start to say - I love Perbacco, and that is why writing this review is difficult to write.I often bring work colleagues and clients for lunch to Perbacco - the food is consistently amazing and the service discrete but attentive.I took 4 people for lunch today and had a wonderful lunch - at the end of the meal we all surprisingly decided to go for a glass of port. I ordered the table 4 glasses of Tawny Port 20 years old ($20 per glass), this took over 20 minutes to arrive at the table which was surprising as our table was next to the bar and we were one of the few tables still occupied in the restaurant. One of guests who loves port commented it was not a 20 year port but much younger - as I'm not a port expert I thought I'd ask to see the bottle to show my guest. I asked our waiter if he could bring us the bottle and some 20minutes later he appeared with an empty port bottle - a 20 year Tawny port. I asked why it took so long to reach over the bar and how come it was empty - there was no response. The bottle had been washed out so I could not show my guest that what we were drinking was really a Tawny 20, and the restaurant had no other bottles.........it all seemed very fishy and we all felt we had been served a sub-standard drink and not what we had ordered. This may all sound snobbish but at $20 a glass I think a wonderful restaurant of this caliber could have managed this situation far better...... I left with a $340 bill feeling like I'd been ripped off and taken advantage of. Will I return? Sadly I feel the spell of Perbacco has been broken......UPDATE*******i received a call from the owner - a lovely gentleman - who explained the mix up with the port and very graciously apologized. I made a lunch reservation and took a client to Perbacco that week and was warmly greeted by the owner. We were also treated to a complimentary and delicious appetizer!

"Came here because I was craving some noodle soup on a slightly chilly SF night. I was seated right away, which would not have been the case for its neighbour San Tung lol. I decided on the Bun rieu because I wanted to try something new.- Bun rieu: although this bowl looked like fire, it wasn't spicy at all. The deep red colour looked a tad unnatural, but at least the soup didn't taste as artificial as it looked haha. The noodles were alright and there were tomatoes (I think?) soaked in the soup. The ground meat-kind-of-balls were heavily seasoned as well. Something was a bit off about the soup though, there was some weird flavour. Not sure what it was and can't really describe it, but it left a strange after taste.I wasn't so satisfied with the Bun rieu. I'm glad I tried it, to try something new, but other than that, I'm not sure I'll come back again soon.",noodles
"Of all the food places we visited in SF, HRD was hands down my absolute favorite place to eat. This place takes Asian fusion to a whole new level, with its creative dishes and unique flavors!The first few times we tried to come here early for on in our trip, the place was closed earlier than we expected, so be sure to check the times in advance! We got there about an hour and a half before closing and the place was jam packed! It's a small place with a long table in the middle with benches, a few stand alone tables in the back, and a few seats by the front window. We were lucky to snag a table in the back. The menu is absolutely amazing, and I love how they fuse together so many different dishes. We settled on the smothered burrito and the spicy pork philly cheese-steak. The smothered burrito was out of this world, lemme tell ya! I loved the Japanese curry that was poured over it, and it went amazingly with the kimchi, crispy chicken, and spicy rice in the burrito! I was full about halfway through the burrito but I pushed myself to consume the whole thing--it was just too tasty to stop eating! My boyfriend has the spicy pork cheese-steak, and halfway through my own meal I started stealing bites of his because it was so good! What a kickass twist to an America classic! We left with happy hearts and bulging tummies, and surprisingly full wallets! It's not too expensive of a dinner meal, and for the quality and taste, I would pay way more than what I did to have it again!","steak,burrito"

"Woof. What an amazing experience here at Zuni Cafe. Sure, the roasted chicken gets a lot of attention, but folks, the burger is the real deal. That's really all you need to know, but if you want to know why? Read on.Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?Excellent. While the 1600 block of Market Street wouldn't be considered by hardly anyone as 'upscale', you forget about all that the moment you walk in the door at Zuni. Hostesses and Servers dressed to the nines compliments a unique multi-room seating arrangement that's brought together by a kitchen that's wide open. It's great. Star Granted.Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?My only gripe here is the cost. Yes, at Zuni you pay for the atmosphere and an excellent product, but at the end of the day that premium can only go so far. For a quality, freshly made burger? I put that cap right at $15.00, and thanks to an unusual 4% surcharge that's on top of menu prices, my burger was $16.25:yelp.com/user_local_phot_Ü_If it came with fries? Fine, but it didn't, and I can't quite justify that price for just a burger. No Star Granted.Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Marvelous on all fronts. Let's start with the bun shall we? WOW. I'll say it, off the top of my head, this was the best burger bun I've had. ever. Fresh bread with a tinge of salt and garlic butter, I could have eaten it sans burger and called it a meal. I didn't, and that's because the burger patty was tip top notch. Freshly ground, cooked to perfection and full of flavor, this patty proved that Zuni knows that a good burger is only as good as it's patty. The topping were almost forgotten purely due to the majesty of the burger/patty combo, but the onions and pickles proved a nice touch. Well done Zuni, well done indeed. Dual Stars Granted.Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?Between chicken of citywide fame and a burger that had me reeling, Zuni Cafe blew me away, and I could easily eat there daily if I could afford it.

Don't forget Grandpa.We won't. Almost a year after his passing my sister and I were here to celebrate life. Specifically Grandma's birthday. The missing fourth was not far from our minds.So it's no surprise the highlight was spaghetti with Grandpa George's sausage and caramelized onions. Rich and delicious. Small portion of this indulgent dish was perfect.Turkey meatballs with garlic bread was also outstanding if soaked in butter. Didn't dare tell Grandma the meatballs weren't meat. She was too busy with the garlic bread. Us too.Pasta blanket was unique (crabmeat and petrale sole covered with pasta) but way too buttery. We ordered a full size and could have done with half that.Cold pasta topped with fresh fish appetizer was another original. Description was more appealing than the end product which was just OK.Butterfish with leeks main was a similar story as the above. Too much butter and not enough of a side to complement the fish. Just barely worth the $25.Complimentary amuse-bouche of some egg and cheese combo was a nice welcome. Bottle of Argentinian Malbec was a reasonable $34 and kept us going all night.Service was friendly but a bit spotty. There were multiple servers and it was hard develop rapport with any of them. Quite a lag between finishing and getting our check.Cable car rolling by is always a nice touch.Judging from the overall rating and packed crowd in a very cozy space my three stars are the exception not the rule.

This place was disgusting. Worst dim sum I have had in my life. When I walked in the restaurant it had a horrible smell, kind of like an old sewage. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and sat through it. I thought it was the typical dim sum place where they push a cart around, but nope. You put in a order and they bring it out. So, I am like huh, this dim sum is about to be the freshest, but boy have I ever been so wrong. The chicken feet tasted like the chicken just got done running around and was soggy too. Everything tasted old and bad. We ordered fried pork bun, tripe, tofu roll, shrimp roll (was so bad, so fishy) and a few more. Worst decision to come here. Never again.","chicken,bun,tripe,roll"
"Good Italian food that a gluten intolerant good-deal-loving girl can enjoy. And if you want to eat Italian food and are allergic to wheat like me? Two words: Northern Italy. Northern Italy is the home of seafood, polenta and the non-breaded, meals NOT engorged with pasta. Thank goodness. This is my favorite Italian restaurant in the bay area. I read the yelp reviews after I had been coming here for years. It makes me happy to see that this place is loved by the community. The little old lady that I strive to grow up to be is fiercely fond of an early bird special and or a coupon. These are the things that really get me hot if you know what I mean. Somehow it has always worked out for me to get a table without a reservation. My friends and I were once poured a glass of red for the while we ducked in to escape the rain. Thank you that. Italian is hard to enjoy for those of us who are allergic to wheat but this place caters to Northern Italian cooking. It is not just about the pasta but red meat, seafood and phenomenal risotto when truffles are in season. OH. MY. God. My favorite thing on the menu is the Caesar salad with fresh crab. This is no Hershey's kiss sized crab portion but rather a lemon sized amount of protein for your starter salad. Belissimo. There are a few restaurants on this fun funky block that will gain my commerce but this is my favorite of the Italians in the city.","pasta,meat,seafood,salad"
"Super friendly waitress. The food came out within minutes. Super small place. Watched the cook hand pull the noodles as we waited for our table. Not a bad way to wait.Authentic chinese food. Ordered the master greens noodle soup, green onion pancake, and beef rolled pancake. The noodle soup and the green onion pancake tastes like something my mom would whip up quickly at home. The beef rolled pancake just tasted like a green onion pancake slathered with oyster sauce with slices of beef on top. No wow factor for me. :(Not worth the hype.","noodles,pancake"
"I don't often find myself in this part of town but now I know where to come and eat. I brought my folks here for my graduation dinner. We were seated promptly, the staff and service was stellar, which I have come to expect from all fine SF dining institutions. Unfortunately their menu changes regularly and when I booked the reservation there were a plethora of vegetarian entree options. When we arrived this was not the case. They managed to hold the beef on the sugo but I feel like they screwed the pooch a little by not offering a non-pizza veggie option. But I digress. The two salads went over well with the family, as did the wine. I had the Funghi pizza and man, oh man, it was probably one of the best mushroom-topped things I have ever munched on that didn't involved giggle fits thirty minutes later. We also split the hen gnocchi, which was neon green and not very noteworthy, although the shredded hen was most excellent. For desert some goat, cow, and goat-cow cheese along with raw honey and pickled cherries (which taste like they sound- gross) and a few cups of blue bottle french pressed at the table. All in all it was grand.","pizza,salad"

So finding an opportunity where we were both in SF was hard. When we saw that there was a Groupon out for them, we found it to be the perfect excuse. We came with our daughter and really took advantage of the fact that we don't come out often by ordering everything we could in hopes to experience as much of the menu as possible. It was truly fantastic and my husband loved it as much as I thought he would. Parking is challenging as it is in most of the city. I was reminding of why we did not have a car when we did live here.

"Reasonable dim sum, but probably not worth driving through the city if you're not close.Arrived at 2, close enough to the end of service that once we got our number, got seated and had a server, it was last call and we were sort of rushed through with little guidance and a lot of 86s. Also seemed much more interested in us ordering off the menu vs just picking things off a cart. So, a bit harder to get what we wanted. Liked the steamed pork buns and dumplings, pot stickers and even ventured the stuffed eggplant (bland) and crab congee (how are you supposed to get that crab out? Weird..). Soy chicken was a bit dry.

"Yay for expensive vegan mexican food.I'll have to admit, vegan mexican food is pretty damn good. Although a bit a skeptical beforehand, I am now a convert. Overall, my friends and I definitely did not miss the meat nor the dairy.Gracias madre has a wide assortment of entrees and main dishes that utilizes the combination of beans, greatly marinaded and seasoned veggies, and protein (tempeh, tofu etc) to satisfied your mexican food craving. All veggies were seasoned and flavored perfectly. Though on the pricier side ($15+) per dish, the portions are huge and able to satiate your hunger.I would recommend almost any of the items on the menu and would recommend having the guacamole to share. They're also very accommodating with substitutions. •_Overall a great choice for those with dietary restrictions and carnivores alike. The horchata...i would skip though. go for the real deal at a mom and pop shop next door.","beans,veggies"

"This is probably my 5th time at SPQR (not easy to get in).I have to say that it keeps getting better.Last night was the best yet.We had the warm corn salad which was spot on.The triple mushroom and chicken wings had great umami flavor and the wings were perfect.The rabbit in ham dish with figs was super complex in flavor and was one of the more unique and flavorable dishes I have had in recent months.The pork tagliatelle was a solid dish, but the others definitely offered more in terms of depth of flavor.Finally, dessert. •_I would be back there right now if I could to have them again. •_Well worth trying the blueberry pie or the triple chocolate and peanut.","mushroom,chickenwings,tagliatelle,dessert"
"This place is pretty solid, we came here for a quick bite, I initially wanted to go to taqueria Cancun however we didn't feel like walking an extra .2 of a mile.We got the burrito special and guacamole with chips. •_The burrito special was pretty tasty, we got carne asada for our choice of meat, it got pretty close to el farolito standards but not quite there. •_The chips and guacamole were a pretty hefty portion, however it felt as if it lacked flavor, it was still good though.This place is pretty good, I'd definitely come back for a burrito, if you can make it to el farolito that's still my top pick.","burrito,guacamole"
Tasty food! Worth the wait? •_ That's debatable. •_ •_They only have 38 seats inside so there is a constant wait time. •_ We waited quite a long time and felt like the food was a little hyped up and maybe not really worth the wait time. •_ But it was good none the less.,food

"If you're not looking for this place, you will never find it. It's a charming little hole in the wall, complete with swinging overhead lights as if a subway car was right above you, although it's quiet. Seating is a small bar that faces an open kitchen, where they cook everything fresh. The people that work there are courteous and sweet. I got the garlic house noodles. They were fabulous. Husband got the black bean tofu, which was very good but I like what I got more. We also got the fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce. Yum. Nothing was too filling. Perfect for lunch. And the prices were LOW. Would definitely go back.","noodles,tofu,rolls"

"I visited this restaurant on 19 June 2012 while on vacation in San Francisco.After reading other reviewers of Taco Bar, I have to wonder if we ate at the same restaurant.Overall, the food is very good. I had two of the pulled pork tacos, which were a special the day I was there. The tacos were on your standard size corn tortilla, like you would find in any local supermarket. Another reviewer mentioned that the tortillas were three inches, mine clearly were not. The pork, which was topped by a small amount of citrus marinated onions, •_was tender, tasty, plentiful and clearly of excellent quality. It was not something that you would see in a cheaper taco and wonder what part of the pig it came from. Each taco was $3.25, and in my opinion worth it. After I was finished eating a a man that I think was the chef came to my table. He was very friendly and recommended the coconut flan. It was as good as he said it would be. It was a denser flan, not jello-like in consistency, and very good. Other reviewers mentioned the small portions that one gets at the Taco Bar. After scoping out what the other patrons were eating and seeing the size of my tacos and flan, I have to wonder again if we were eating at the same restaurant.Another reviewer mentioned that this place is ""deceptive"". I didn't find it so, but if you are doubtful about this place just check out a menu and look around at what others are eating. When I was there the place was very crowded and busy, a deceptive place wouldn't have such a crowd I would think.As for the price, I believe it was fair, given the quality of the food and the quick and friendly service. I found the food at Taco Bar food to be authentic. I come from Los Angeles and have a good idea as to what good Mexican food is thanks to my Mexican friends, colleagues and students. This place is worth your time and cash, check it out, you won't be sorry.","taco,tortilla,service,price"
"I've been coming here for years and have finally had enough. This place has gone downhill!!! The food lacks so much flavor and isn't worth the price and the service is just as bad. The workers here make it so damn obvious that they hate their job like I'm not here to deal with your shitty attitude man I just want something decent to eat here. Pretty sad considering I actually enjoyed eating here before, but never again","food,price,service"
"I keep trying Mijita and I want to like it. But I just can't. •_The food doesn't have any flavor. Spent over $9.00 on a ""bowl"" of tortilla soup....and it was more like a cup.

"We came to visit San Francisco for memorial weekend as a gift to my girlfriend and brothers, we use to live here and enjoyed all the activities and food culture here but other than wanting to be in the city and visit pier 39 we stumbled upon Mama's on Washington square. And just like everyone says....expect a wait. It's not one of those waits were you get in and it wasn't great, but a wait where you get there, eat, then realize the wait was well worth. I had the French toast cinnamon swirl and that was complimented with some nice fruits on top, all I can say is this was by far a good highlight for our trip back home.",toast
"Their burritos aren't really good. They make it really fast though! I don't think this place is authentic enough for me. Not enough flavor, a bit bland, seems a bit Americanized? so to speak. I'd say it's comparable to Chipotle. Then again, some people love Chipotle. But if you want a real good burrito, go to the Mission. You won't be disappointed, that's forsure.",burrito
"I had the carne asada (steak) burrito and my friend had the pollo (chicken) burrito. They were both fantastic. The rice is extremely flavorful, the meat juicy and delicious, and the beans and sauces combine to create what is probably the best burrito I've ever had (and yes, I've been to La Taqueria). This is now definitely my go to burrito place in SF. The burritos are better than those at La Taqueria, and there is almost no line. All in all you'll have your food in 5 or so minutes. Fantastic place.",burrito
"Came here on Valentines day and was not disappointed at all. When I think Mexican food, I think heavy and fattening, but this place challenged that stereotype, because we left feeling satisfied enough to where we were full but not in a negative ""want to sleep"" way. For our starter we had Corn that was DELICIOUS! I don't know how they seemed to make eating corn on the cob fancy but they nailed it. For dinner i had the chicken burrito and a bit of my friends shrimp taco, both which were mouth watering. The mango sauce with my burrito paired very well and it was decent sized and filling. I defiantly will be coming back when I am in the area to try there other items. It's really hard to find a place where the service is good, the food is clean, not heavy but filling and this place is one of them!","burrito,corn,taco"

"My aunt and I used to order lunch to-go here at least once a week! At one point, the lady taking the orders recognized my voice and knew to give me extra hot sauce automatically! We love their duck leg noodle(with the twisty egg noodle) and beef noodles(with the flat rice noodles)! The duck leg is always meaty and flavorful and the beef from the beef noodles is always tender and the broth is delicious!

"Since we had all ready parked our car, we didn't want to drive or Uber to Chinatown, I remember Yang Sing from 20 years ago, the original one located at 101 Spear. This one was the closest that we could walk to. We had a 20 minute wait during lunch hour, which isn't too bad. •_The price of dim sum is quite expensive, i.e. 2 crab claws was $14 a plate. Hey, we are on vacation. The food was filling and tasty, but if you were in Chinatown, you'd probably would get away with half the cost.When you order tea for yourself, they bring a big pot and charge everyone at the table. So, if you're the only one drinking tea, make sure you let the server know and then check the bill after.Since I'm a native San Franciscan, I'd probably go somewhere else for dim sum.

There was a pretty long line at the counter, but we were able to snag a table pretty easily after ordering.The Cali Steak Zapato looked the most interesting to me - a pressed/grilled burrito filled with skirt steak asada, cheese, avocado, salsa, and fries.

"The first time I ate here, I thought it was pretty great. The next two times: not so much.Stale chips in paper wrapper. Practically empty salsa station. Grungy tables and chairs outside.

"SPQR was on our list for some time and I thought I'd love it. I did really enjoy the chicken liver mousse and jam- would 100% eat that every day if I could get away with it. The tuna tartare was covered in sauce, I couldn't taste the light flavor of the fish in a dish I generally enjoy. I ate the corn ravioli and it's probably my fault for ordering incorrectly, but I didn't finish and drank a lot of water because it wasn't moist enough without it. I generally like the sweetness of corn but if that's what you're looking for, this was far more umami than sweet. The dessert was a passionfruit panna cotta that was way too sweet (ironic I know), it overpowered the delicate coconut cream and the caramel sauce on top. I did like my marshmallow at the end :) •_TL:DR •_If I go back, I'm ordering the mousse and getting different pasta.","mousse,jam,tartare,fish,cream,pasta"
"Pros- HUGE burritos- Great fillings- Tortilla was nice and crispy- A lot of carne asadaCons - Cash only - Wasn't a fan of the communal seatingGreat burritos a couple blocks away from 16th+Mission Bart. They're cash only and the line wasn't that long around 6pm on Friday. Friend and I went here after checking out the Nate Silver Burrito Bracket, when Taqueria Cancun ousted El Farolito. But, imo, the carne asada burrito is not as good as El Farolito's. It comes down to the meat and this meat was less flavorful than El Farolito's.",burritos
"Oh, El Farolito! Such a Bay Area staple! Who can resist coming here in the wee hours of the morning for some of them street tacos?! Well, I sure in the hell can't! Buuut I'm sorry to say... this location just ain't all that it's cracked up to be. Well, at least not anymore?! Maybe I came on a bad night but the last time that I was here, the tacos were just alright. Last time I was here, I was craving for some steak tacos. I got four of those bad boys because I was being greedy, but I literally could only finish two. One thing that isn't lacking here is portion size! They stuff their tacos to the max with meat and one taco is really more like two. The salsa here is BOMBSY! Their green salsa and pico de gallo are heaven! Chips and salsa are complimentary with your order and they have salsa bar where you can load up on that bomb ass salsa! Despite all of this, my experience was just meh. The workers looked exhausted and didn't seem like they wanted to really be there. The inside was pretty dirty with several tables that were cluttered with all kinds of trash and half eaten food. The chips were stale and the steak on my tacos this time around had minimal flavor. Even after dousing them in that good ol' salsa, something was still lacking for me. And don't let me even get started on that bathroom... yikes. With the kind of business that they get here, you would at least think that they would try to upkeep the cleanliness. Overall, it's a dependable source for late night eats, but I would probably just go to their main location next time if it's not a hassle to get there.",tacos
"This was beyond my expectations. Burrata: Creamier than ones we've had elsewhere and fantastic!Focaccinis (mini focaccia buns)- So soft and delicious with a good amount of spice as a topping. For some reason, they reminded me of gougeres and I just wish they had filled the focaccinis with some cheese :)Artichoke salad: I'm not an artichoke fan, but it was seasoned just right and so tender. Entrees:Agnoletti: What flavor! Normally, I am used to pasta getting drenched with sauce that I can barely taste the filling. OMG, the filling was full of deliciously seasoned meat and I savored every bite. I had originally thought of it as an indulgent comfort food, but it became a mini party-in-my-mouth with every bite of agnoletti. The individual agnoletti were tiny, but packed a bunch of flavor! Fish: My hubby had this because he's on a low-carb diet and he said it was fantastic. It was cooked really nicely all in all, given that my hubby was on a low-carb diet, we thought that our limited options would decrease our/his enjoyment. Boy, were we wrong.

We had the sashimi for an appetizer and it did not disappoint! Super fresh! My al pastor tacos were delicious as well, and the service was good.

I found this place to be highly rated on yelp and went based on their recommendations.

I loved that their fries were cooked PERFECTLY and came with an amazing kimchi aoli. I seriously could drink that if i wanted!! The price is on the higher side.

There was a long line outside when we pulled up and was thankful that I called ahead of time to order. (It only took 20min to make if you order ahead of time and you can walk straight up to the register to pickup and pay) The Ami-Cado is what I had - pastrami, salami and avocado with everything. That Lou's special sauce thoit gave a slight hint of spiciness that made the sandwich ê_ber delicious. The LLB Special was, in my opinion, just ok. Had a few bites to try it, but Dutch crunch just ain't my thing and I didn't enjoy one of the meats in there.","place,sandwich"

First of all the music thy were blaring was rap music with explicit content, which I did not appreciate. Secondly, they are over priced for what you get in quality of food.

Both times I've come here with my family on a weekday, and we were one of a few other tables in the entire place. And this place is huge.
